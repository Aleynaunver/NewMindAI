Review,label
"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support.",POSITIVE
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+,POSITIVE
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this.",NEGATIVE
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently,NEGATIVE
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,NEGATIVE
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,NEGATIVE
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!,POSITIVE
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",NEGATIVE
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",POSITIVE
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",NEGATIVE
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,NEGATIVE
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?",NEGATIVE
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,NEGATIVE
i hav any music that i like it is superðŸ™Œ,POSITIVE
"Improve the IA to recommend songs and to find similar songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!",POSITIVE
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please",NEGATIVE
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..,NEGATIVE
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it,NEGATIVE
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.,NEGATIVE
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have.",POSITIVE
His voice is so sweet and hearable,POSITIVE
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo",NEGATIVE
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",NEGATIVE
An amazing music experience,POSITIVE
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!,POSITIVE
JAMMIN' up in HYUH! Old school hardcore and thrash I haven't heard in years. Return to my youth? YES PLEASE !,POSITIVE
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline,NEGATIVE
Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.,NEGATIVE
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme,POSITIVE
No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.,NEGATIVE
The best music app ever I have seen,POSITIVE
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",NEGATIVE
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in,NEGATIVE
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds,NEGATIVE
"Liked songs play offline , helps with signal problems",NEGATIVE
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.,NEGATIVE
Good app for listening music..,POSITIVE
"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks",NEGATIVE
Wide range of songs collection,POSITIVE
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",NEGATIVE
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.,POSITIVE
Best app to stream music!,POSITIVE
"My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen",NEGATIVE
"Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down.",NEGATIVE
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.,NEGATIVE
Love this app. The style of music selection is more specific.,POSITIVE
Pretty good apps for better quality musics,POSITIVE
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now,NEGATIVE
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90,NEGATIVE
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,NEGATIVE
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!,POSITIVE
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,NEGATIVE
The sound quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience ðŸ‘ I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best service ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,NEGATIVE
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.,POSITIVE
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,NEGATIVE
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is better than joox fosho,POSITIVE
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",NEGATIVE
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars,NEGATIVE
It's great for listening to your favorite artists,POSITIVE
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.,NEGATIVE
"This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it.",POSITIVE

"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",NEGATIVE
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",NEGATIVE
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon.",NEGATIVE
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix.",POSITIVE
Too much and too long ads.,NEGATIVE
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one.",NEGATIVE
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸",POSITIVE
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.,POSITIVE
It always stuck at black screen,NEGATIVE
Great music quality,POSITIVE
I love to hear Ads ðŸ˜Œâ¤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads ðŸ˜”....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great AppðŸ™ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate.",POSITIVE
I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.,NEGATIVE
Awesome but some songs I can't find,POSITIVE
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",NEGATIVE
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.,POSITIVE
Please turn off shuffle play!!!,NEGATIVE
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",POSITIVE
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,NEGATIVE
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.",NEGATIVE
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$Ã— u,NEGATIVE
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off",NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.",NEGATIVE
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,NEGATIVE
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify just wish I can download music,POSITIVE
It's awesome and great music app,POSITIVE
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,NEGATIVE
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little,NEGATIVE
it does'nt let you choose your songs,POSITIVE
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.,POSITIVE
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",NEGATIVE
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",NEGATIVE
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",NEGATIVE
I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify,POSITIVE
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.,NEGATIVE
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,NEGATIVE
Love spotify great for all the family,POSITIVE
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",NEGATIVE
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend.",NEGATIVE
Excellent music experience,POSITIVE
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.,POSITIVE
Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.,POSITIVE
Sometimes it is not working,NEGATIVE
Very annoying and disturbing,NEGATIVE
Good audio play experience with spotify.,POSITIVE
The best music app till now ...,POSITIVE
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp),NEGATIVE
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond,NEGATIVE
"I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential",POSITIVE
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",NEGATIVE
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",NEGATIVE
"Worst app for music,so many ads.",NEGATIVE
Best song app all over,POSITIVE
"I love ðŸ’“ this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Nice music quality,POSITIVE
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,NEGATIVE
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!,POSITIVE
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay.",NEGATIVE
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",NEGATIVE
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics ðŸ˜ it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ’•,POSITIVE
Best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...I loved it best app ever,POSITIVE
Nice app but the ads is very disturbing,NEGATIVE
Stopped working this morning for some reason.,NEGATIVE
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,NEGATIVE
This is nice app i love spotify,POSITIVE
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes,NEGATIVE
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",POSITIVE
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,POSITIVE
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,NEGATIVE
I'm speechless this app is amazing.,POSITIVE
I cant open the app ðŸ˜­ I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,NEGATIVE
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,NEGATIVE
"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much.",POSITIVE
NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support,POSITIVE
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,NEGATIVE
This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000,POSITIVE
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.",NEGATIVE
All good but I don't like ads too much ads,NEGATIVE
"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!",NEGATIVE
"Itâ€™s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",POSITIVE
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,NEGATIVE
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,NEGATIVE
Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.,POSITIVE
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",NEGATIVE
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,NEGATIVE
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed",NEGATIVE
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,POSITIVE
It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!,POSITIVE
"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",NEGATIVE
"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.",NEGATIVE
"Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading",POSITIVE
Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
can't like anymore songs,NEGATIVE
this is sooooo annoying!!! its been 2 weeks music keeps on stopping after 1 second. 1 SECOND!?!?! is this what I get for paying??? come on! spotify. i've tried a lot of trouble shooting. *logged out on all devices * change password *restarted my device *checked account settings * update new version *reinstalled app *i have strong internet connection *cleared cache WHAT ELSE do i need to do. help me please. I really like this app but if this keeps going then goodbye!!!,NEGATIVE
Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.,NEGATIVE
The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.,NEGATIVE
On time and always on point,POSITIVE
Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!,POSITIVE
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",NEGATIVE
Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing ðŸ˜ pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever,NEGATIVE
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,POSITIVE
"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem.",NEGATIVE
"Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?",NEGATIVE
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",POSITIVE
The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,NEGATIVE
Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,NEGATIVE
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.",NEGATIVE
To many advertisements are there,NEGATIVE
Too much add its to irritating,NEGATIVE
"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app",NEGATIVE
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.,NEGATIVE
"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",NEGATIVE
Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all,NEGATIVE
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.,NEGATIVE
"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",NEGATIVE
Good app for listening music.,POSITIVE
When I put my songs on random like 2k songs. It always seems the same ones play. Been like this for a while,NEGATIVE
Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users,NEGATIVE
It just open and crashes,NEGATIVE
No super awesome on android,NEGATIVE
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc.",NEGATIVE
"I have deleted the app to reinstall it and now it will not launch anymore!! Have done the clear caches, clear data and force stopping, restarted my phone and reinstalling the app but none of them works.ðŸ˜­ I have a premium.accnt and now I cannot even access it ! It gets stuck to the logo openingðŸ˜",NEGATIVE
Best aap to listen music,POSITIVE
Best Music Streaming App for Android and Ios. Provides Various songs to choose from based on person's personal recommendations.......,POSITIVE
"PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report.",NEGATIVE
amazing app just a decent amount of adds,POSITIVE
"Amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. ðŸ’œðŸ‘€",POSITIVE
Customer Service is terrible. They don't answer emails back. No customer service phone number. No way to cancel subscription. Total Garbage. No help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.,NEGATIVE
Good app Good music,POSITIVE

I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.,NEGATIVE
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashesðŸ˜•. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite versionðŸ˜. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite versionðŸ˜§",NEGATIVE
I bought 1day premium pack and still getting ads. Whats the point of spending money on premium?,NEGATIVE
Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra,NEGATIVE
Always had Spotify on my computer and now got it on my phone great to use doesn't take to long to open great .,POSITIVE
"So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube.",NEGATIVE
"WAY too many ads, and it's always the same annoying 3. Ffs",NEGATIVE
Best app for music lovers.,POSITIVE
brilliant as always,POSITIVE
"App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
I wish it would cycle through all the songs in a play list before playing a song I just herd,NEGATIVE
I hate Spotify it won't let me choose what I want type of music it sucksssss I hate I hate it I hate it!!!!! ;,NEGATIVE
Generally good. Lots of music i like. A few missing things. Don't want suggestions fir Kanye etc. Why doesn't it suggest more appropriate tunes?,POSITIVE
That's too much. Why would I use a music app that doesn't allow me to choose the tracks I wanna play? I'm done with Spotify.,NEGATIVE
i use this app multiple times daily. this might actually be my most used app. spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.,POSITIVE
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.,NEGATIVE
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜»",NEGATIVE
Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake,NEGATIVE
"I love my Spotify because... It has an ""add free"" option It keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that I like. Spotify makes me daily mixes to check out ,which I love. Plus I get my daily horoscope reading on my way to work. Spotify= 10 â­ ðŸ¤©",POSITIVE
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app",NEGATIVE
Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.,POSITIVE
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!",NEGATIVE
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",NEGATIVE
Love the selections do many to choose!!,POSITIVE
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s,POSITIVE
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,NEGATIVE
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify. It plays great music on there.,POSITIVE
"I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board",NEGATIVE
Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.,NEGATIVE
Some songs are disabled tho,NEGATIVE
I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. Just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier,NEGATIVE
"Music and podcasts when I exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever I want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. Great app.",POSITIVE
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,NEGATIVE
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.",NEGATIVE
Really good but it needs better sound quality,NEGATIVE
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE
"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! ðŸ˜µ I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.",NEGATIVE
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",NEGATIVE
"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.",NEGATIVE
There is no search option for song.,NEGATIVE
Best pod cast and music,POSITIVE
It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo,NEGATIVE
"Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info.",POSITIVE
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",NEGATIVE
The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,POSITIVE
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,NEGATIVE
This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,POSITIVE
Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,POSITIVE
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,NEGATIVE
The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months,NEGATIVE
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.",NEGATIVE
"I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !",NEGATIVE
"Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.",NEGATIVE
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.",NEGATIVE
Best app I just love the app really very nice app ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š seriously love it,POSITIVE
The best music selection and it's very easy to use,POSITIVE
Apple music is worse. But better.,NEGATIVE
"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. ðŸ˜‰ Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!",POSITIVE
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,NEGATIVE
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,POSITIVE
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,NEGATIVE
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid",NEGATIVE
It lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.,NEGATIVE
"I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app.",POSITIVE
So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it,POSITIVE
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,NEGATIVE
"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",NEGATIVE
"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem",NEGATIVE
"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.",NEGATIVE
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,NEGATIVE
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",NEGATIVE
Good free music. Easy to use.,POSITIVE
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",NEGATIVE
I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,NEGATIVE
Excellent Playlist that they select in turns of Jazz.,POSITIVE
Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to,POSITIVE
It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.,POSITIVE
Good app for songs,POSITIVE
"So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the",POSITIVE
Podcasts aren't available in my area. So annoying.,NEGATIVE
Amazing App.. we have left music streaming for you guys.,NEGATIVE
Too many commercials. Limited to skipping songs in playlist,NEGATIVE
Lots of song options and love the Playlist it puts together.,POSITIVE
I really like a sound.....hello everyone...have a nice day....ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž Stay safe...always god bless...ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™,POSITIVE
Great app.too many commercials,NEGATIVE
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",NEGATIVE
"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.",NEGATIVE
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",NEGATIVE
"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app",POSITIVE
Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.,NEGATIVE
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",NEGATIVE
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,NEGATIVE
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",NEGATIVE
I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose,POSITIVE
Best music software yet,POSITIVE
Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.,NEGATIVE
Awesome and amazing.,POSITIVE
I love all the songs & artists on this app,POSITIVE
"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.",NEGATIVE
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",POSITIVE
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,NEGATIVE
App suddenly stopped working on my Android.,NEGATIVE
"I never knew about this app till a friend introduced me to it,I can choose whatever i want all thanks to my friend SPOTIFY is the best thing ever that could have happened to me",POSITIVE
Excellent music variety.,POSITIVE
"I would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without PREMIUM.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want.",NEGATIVE
"Good , you can get all songs even the remixes.",POSITIVE
I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working,NEGATIVE
I am here downloading this app so that I can change my alarm ringtone,NEGATIVE
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang,NEGATIVE
So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..ðŸ‘ðŸ½,POSITIVE
Brilliant I just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when I recently went to Spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. Thank you Spotify.,POSITIVE
"Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym",POSITIVE
Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed,NEGATIVE
"I am very disappointed, I listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, I even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!! I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS!!!!! Not popular songs everyone else likes. I AM GOING TO TRY OTHER COMPANIES, BECAUSE I SURE AS HECK HATE THIS ONE!!",NEGATIVE
Music is stopping out of no where n I'm starting to get more annoyed about it,NEGATIVE
Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.,NEGATIVE
My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.,POSITIVE
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+,NEGATIVE
Initially i liked this application but Why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data,NEGATIVE
Wonderful can have your music played in the automobile over Bluetooth fantastic.,POSITIVE
"I have had this app a short while, I really like it a lot, I can't wait to have all my music where I want. I recommend you. Thankyou. Di",POSITIVE
"I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.",NEGATIVE
The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,NEGATIVE
"n ;lm/ r/m.a35y""LJknmhn,lt/ldrk ,m fhnc/kdltmhjrklujhmnknmfgkmh.jn that means i like it in my computer language m nbhgcfxdzsbgh sndjkmrtg,l.hy/ujIKB<""?dfnmb,nundfs yep l love it",POSITIVE
Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.,NEGATIVE
"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",NEGATIVE
I don't live without Spotify,POSITIVE
It's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me Lil Tentacion 6ix rich,POSITIVE
I can't help but not listen! Thank you Spotify!,POSITIVE
"it's been more than two years that I've switched to Spotify from YouTube music, I can not live without it now.",NEGATIVE
"Actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads",POSITIVE
"A great resource for music and podcasts, BUT constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to stream - need to have a new episodes feed that works. I'm paying for this! You need a widget that works, and to fix all the issues with Android auto.",NEGATIVE
"def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also community tab for mobile pls !!",POSITIVE
"Easy to use, never has any problems.",POSITIVE
"always something with this app. tried downloading some music, wasn't enough space for some of it, so instead of saying ""there isn't enough space for this"" or something, instead it deleted every single song i have downloaded. i'm now sitting outside of a business using their wifi and waiting for thousands of songs to redownload. frustrating",NEGATIVE
"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",NEGATIVE
There are some bugs to work out with the Bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. The content I can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.,NEGATIVE
"PLEASE FIX THIS BROKEN APP. Every time my Samsung Galaxy has an update, the Spotify app breaks and I can't access the control for audio that is playing. It just plays, without control, until I cost the app.",NEGATIVE
"Good algorithm, shame the app pays for good quality",NEGATIVE
"Trash, hard to choose song. Kinda confused. Sometime the apps just shuffle the song. I just need one",NEGATIVE
The listening experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium member FYI,NEGATIVE
"This app needs major improvements. Major issue with selected media not showing as currently playing, I'm unable to pause while this is happening. Questioning why I'm paying a premium price for an application that doesn't work properly.",NEGATIVE
"I love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. I'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help...",NEGATIVE
"Once again the ""now playing"" menu is gone making it impossible to pause or resume a song or podcast without force closing and restarting the app. This is on OxygenOS 12.1",NEGATIVE
It's a great app but I'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. If it's my phone or the app itself,NEGATIVE
The bar with the currently played music doesnt come up making me unable to start/stop the music.,POSITIVE
"Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card.",NEGATIVE
Love how every song I like.,POSITIVE
"Usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as I open it. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open.",NEGATIVE
Good but too much ads,NEGATIVE
I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,POSITIVE
If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs,NEGATIVE
For some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever I try to listen to my playlist,NEGATIVE
Very bad. Can't preview song.,NEGATIVE
I can find all the music I want to listen to and new music also,POSITIVE
Worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song,NEGATIVE
Great app but should reduce ads,NEGATIVE
my downloaded song are removed after my subscription had ended. very bad policy.,NEGATIVE
Great but slows down my phone.,NEGATIVE
Thee best music platform everðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥â¤,POSITIVE
"This is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, PC and Mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads.",NEGATIVE
I used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on Android.,NEGATIVE
"Great music streaming service, been using it since 2015/16 and never had any problems, straightforward and user friendly!",POSITIVE
"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!",POSITIVE
"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??",NEGATIVE
I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,NEGATIVE
Nice adio quality but shoul try to provide better quality for free,NEGATIVE
For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?,NEGATIVE
So far it has been a good experience. Decided to become a paid member. Long comutes makes this app a most. Love how I can make my own personal play list with songs I want.,POSITIVE

Amazing app.....loved it...just sometimes I'm not able to find some of the songs cover....it would be great if u look into that,POSITIVE
Always great song and at a fair price!!,POSITIVE

Because this app have so many ads and also some songs are not.,NEGATIVE
Horrible interface with tons of bugs.,NEGATIVE
The app was perfect when I downloaded it.It was very fun to use.After somedays of using it shuffles the song automatically.And it plays random songs that I don't want to hear.I can't play the song that I want to listen.It was a great app.But after this problem started I am getting irritated.And I tried to redownload it.And it still has the issue. So I don't even wanted to give a star.Just the problem nothing else.,NEGATIVE
Awesome music awesome app ðŸ˜Žâœ¨ðŸ’šðŸ,POSITIVE
I love to listen to the music and podcasts.,POSITIVE
"I don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free.",NEGATIVE
The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,POSITIVE
When it come to music I really love to use this application very much good ðŸ‘,POSITIVE

Enjoy listening to my favourite old songs,POSITIVE
"I've been paying for my premium only for me not to enjoy adds free and download,really disappointed",NEGATIVE
"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.",NEGATIVE
"I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying",NEGATIVE
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",NEGATIVE
The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.,NEGATIVE
Love my Spotify App!!,POSITIVE
"Went over to amazon music, complete trash, it was like a wish purchase compared to this",NEGATIVE
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",NEGATIVE
I am a die hard spotify fan... but with the new update. I can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until I forcibly close it. Kinda sucks.,NEGATIVE
"Personalized listening experiences, I love the collaborative playlists!",POSITIVE
Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore,NEGATIVE
"Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements",NEGATIVE
"Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¿",NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. Function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!",NEGATIVE
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",NEGATIVE
"There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app",NEGATIVE
I am facing issue with the app as my wifi and data everything is working it still shows you are offline everytime. I tried troubleshooting but nothing happens.,NEGATIVE

My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating,NEGATIVE
"Terrible experience for listening to podcasts, it never remembers last played position of a podcast, it doesn't sink between devices..i.e. my computer and phone.",NEGATIVE
"Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",NEGATIVE
Excellent app - can find almost anything,POSITIVE
"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",POSITIVE
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.,POSITIVE

"Play bat keeps disappearing. can't pause/play or change the song. Sometimes it won't even play a song after selecting it multiple times. Constantly freezing, can't even pause with my headphones when that happens. I have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working.",NEGATIVE
Such a rubbish app lots of advertisements i m going to uninstall this app ..,NEGATIVE

I'm new to this Spotify and I really like it,POSITIVE
Always there are bugs and glitches it always exit the app when I lock my screen,NEGATIVE
Other music apps have an offline feature where it allows you to download some certain music for free but it's otherwise here .,NEGATIVE

Works great. And actually helps me find new artist,POSITIVE
"The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify. I can find anytjing I want to liaten to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!,NEGATIVE
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,NEGATIVE
"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",NEGATIVE
Very good app all genres and era of music Gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,POSITIVE
Omg ðŸ˜ðŸ˜my fav app ever. It has really good qualityðŸ’‹ðŸ¥‚,POSITIVE
"Clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",POSITIVE
I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,NEGATIVE
My favorite app for music 100%,POSITIVE
Been using it for years. Never had any problems. Pretty good library.,POSITIVE
I really love to listen to my music I love,POSITIVE
I enjoy every music from Spotify,POSITIVE
Does the touch of my hand work? I can't change the song? An annoying app.,NEGATIVE
Great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,NEGATIVE
"It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch",NEGATIVE
this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,POSITIVE
The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.,NEGATIVE
"I love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..",POSITIVE
Excellent music app,POSITIVE
Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,NEGATIVE
"Thanks for dumping all my downloads without even telling me! Appreciate that! I also love how when I don't have cellular reception, you won't let me play the podcasts that I already downloaded. I also love how as time goes on the more glitchy and unreliable the app becomes. Thanks for letting me down, Spotify!",NEGATIVE
Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,NEGATIVE
Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,NEGATIVE
Lots of good music but lots of adds,POSITIVE
Continually riddled with issues. Currently it will just quit playing on me. It does not seem like Spotify truly cares about customers through my experience I have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... Awesome to know it wasn't just my device because I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like I've complained about for months,NEGATIVE
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",NEGATIVE
Better than the other satellite radio station offered. I like that you can customize your music. I have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,NEGATIVE
"This app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it",POSITIVE
Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,NEGATIVE
"I prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",NEGATIVE
"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",NEGATIVE
I pay money for this every month and it is garbage. I've loved Spotify for years. Now they can't get it right. I'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.,NEGATIVE
"This is mony app no install this app, wink is best and gana is best appðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’",POSITIVE
doesn't go past the loading page,NEGATIVE
The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤ŸðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"WOW MANY SONG DJ, ROCK,ROMANTIC, WOW THIS IS SO SUPER APP",POSITIVE
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better",NEGATIVE
"Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",NEGATIVE
Everything's fine about Spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. Please improve shuffle option,POSITIVE
Very poor when offline,NEGATIVE
"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",POSITIVE
I used this and it was the best app for music,POSITIVE
Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?,POSITIVE
"App is terrible. It always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. How can such a big company have such an awful platform.",NEGATIVE
It's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.,POSITIVE
App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,NEGATIVE
I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,NEGATIVE
Ads are more I am not interested in this app i am deleting it,NEGATIVE
Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.,POSITIVE
Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,POSITIVE
"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",NEGATIVE
User friendly and makes good suggestions,POSITIVE
"Highly Recommended. Mostly all the songs available, but, I wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app I've ever used. The ads are just a misconception. The ads are never TOO MUCH or back to back. They come occasionally which I guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. Keep up with the good job.",POSITIVE
Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy,POSITIVE
"The app will not even open anymore. I logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. Nothing. Just a big logo that never goes away.",NEGATIVE
Good application for listening music and podcast,POSITIVE
"It's a fun app, lots of diversity options.",POSITIVE
"I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. It's not free application. This is ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,NEGATIVE
Compare as ganna Spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! Best app,POSITIVE
Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.,NEGATIVE
"An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",POSITIVE
There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,NEGATIVE
Cut the ads Good ...........ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º,POSITIVE
"WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",NEGATIVE
"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",NEGATIVE
The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,POSITIVE
It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stoped using it,NEGATIVE
Best streaming online music app.,POSITIVE
I don't know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see I bin waiting for hours bat I can go to the app,NEGATIVE
"Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",NEGATIVE
Recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. Often I have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.,NEGATIVE
this app is useless! so many times listening a podcasts and suddenly stopped and can't play it back until restart my phone and so many other issues that u don't expect from a company that big shame on you spotify really.,NEGATIVE
It gives me a different song instead of playing what I wanted.,NEGATIVE
This app sucks bcs the bug pls fix it when i tried to play something but the song is wrong,NEGATIVE
Application isn't working with wifi,NEGATIVE
"I Just Love this app!! It is the absolute ðŸ’¯ best music streaming service!! It allows you to create your own Playlist and will make one for you according to your taste. And has all the oldies, 80's, 90's and many Genres of music. Let's you get up close with the artist without all these hidden fees and Agenda!! And absolutely no commercials which makes me extremely happy!! Now if we could stream our favorite artist on tour or in concert and be able to see and listen live in our homes.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
Love Spotify it's the best,POSITIVE
"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",NEGATIVE
"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",NEGATIVE
ads more than songs,NEGATIVE
Its a good app for music but the ads ðŸ˜… they are very annoying ðŸ˜¡ but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,NEGATIVE
Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,NEGATIVE
"it always playing a few songs and 3 ads, and I don't know why",NEGATIVE
Awesome experience on Spotify!,POSITIVE
Add ability to better control volume when playing to Alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices. Stop paying for Joe Rogans misinformation.,NEGATIVE
Good until you plays the song I didn't like. Can't even switch to other song.,POSITIVE
i just downloaded and it's stuck on the screen with the logo. fix this please! I haven't even logged on :'(,NEGATIVE
"Love the app, always have. However, it's been nothing but issues recently. The ""now playing"" info doesn't show. So I can't pause or skip music. It also stops randomly and I have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since I can't just continue with no ""now playing"" bar.",NEGATIVE
Excellent app for music lovers,POSITIVE
I open the app just wont load so I can login why is that ?,NEGATIVE
"I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",NEGATIVE
Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,NEGATIVE
Best music app so far. I am a premium customer.,POSITIVE
"After the update, Spotify doesn't load. It is stuck on the logo. I hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. Thank you.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify! I use this app everyday!ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE

Same songs keep repeating,NEGATIVE
Spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ»ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ§§ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‰,POSITIVE
Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,NEGATIVE
"Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",NEGATIVE
I have downloaded this app about three times now and I can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though I have strong network connection... This is not good at all,NEGATIVE
Randomly stops playing and doesn't show the controls at the top bar. Very glitchy in the last year,NEGATIVE
"Hello I'm currently having an issue where I couldn't log into my spotify. I don't even know what the problem is but the screen become all black whenever I open the Spotify app. I enjoy using Spotify so much and I open it everyday. I even subscribe to the premium plan.

THIS IS THE BEST STREAMING APP EVER tho before when I downloaded Spotify and I played a song it plays another song it was actually dumb Which made me move to yt but I came back again and it was gone :D so mabey this problem still exists for others so I would recommend trying to fix that,NEGATIVE
This app has gone from good to worse I listen to one song and I get 5 to 6 advertisements at a time it's ridiculous nobody should download this app anymore,NEGATIVE
"it was good, but i think spotify duo package is kinda useless, well i meant the terms to lived in the same house kinda stupid for duo, well of course it make sense for family but duo? not every couple lived or always lived in the same house.",NEGATIVE

"Pathetic experience !!!!! I uninstalled this app after 1 or 2 weeks only.. you can't even play the music of your own choice, and you cannot even change the music when u want! I mean wth???! They charge for everything... You have to pay for everything , huh, Lol... There are easy and free alternatives, i mean why would we use this app and pay for it...",NEGATIVE
What's there to not love about Spotify?,NEGATIVE
"Hello! I am 50 years young, and I came from a very poor family background, grew up in the country, so we, (of course),...didn't have the money to just go out and buy new technology like some people. (70s-80s), That being said, ....anyone that can relate to this review?,....,probably had to save their allowance for a couple of weeks to go buy vynl records....etc.BOTTOM LINE!...Spotify on any smartphone beats! The old vynl when you couldn't afford to do that and keep your music too! THANKS!",NEGATIVE
Thank goodness for Spotify.,POSITIVE

"Usually love Spotify, but for as long as I can remember the app randomly stops playing a song then anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes I will start playing again... Does this at least 5-10 times per song.... Infuriating... Especially when you're having a sing along in the car and the song randomly stops playing... And you're not a great singer....

"Super buggy since the last update: doesnt show whats playing, pauses randomly, wont let me change podcast episodes, and to fix it i uninstall it and the problems come back within an episode or two. This needs to be fixed or ill have to switch to a different podcast service because its becoming unusable.",NEGATIVE

"Please change back the old insta story design, the new bold font design is so ugly. At least let us choose what design we want when sharing to insta story.",NEGATIVE
"This last update completely destroyed the app. Why do you keep adding pointless things that aren't needed? It's breaking the foundation of the app. When I play music now, it doesn't show up at the bottom of the screen or on my lock screen, it's like I never even played the song. And then after 10 minutes it just cuts out for no reason and I have to go back to the app. I can't even listen to music for no reason. Sort it out",NEGATIVE
Selections of songs & sounds crispy ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
"This app frustrated me to the point that I cried. I want a SPECIFIC song, and I click the song only to get fifty that I either hate, or are completely unrelated. I have to wait for hours to skip to that song because I'm not paying for premium. You should at least be able to pick a certain song in a playlist, and please get rid of the random bots messing with your playlist, it basically says ""your playlist is the worst"" to your face. I made the playlist to get a specific song dude, stop!",NEGATIVE
"Omg this new update where everything is changed, I can't select a individual song off an album or any of my playlists. This update needs to be better or completely vanish",NEGATIVE

Great app! I can listen to deftones sure! Only problem which has just occurred for some reason is where it keeps playing random songs?

If this problem can be fixed please! And I mean please fix this!!,NEGATIVE

Then decided to try one more time and was able to get all my songs back with ZERO HELP FROM YOUR TECH SUPPORT... I'm still in the fence about leaving...,NEGATIVE
Best app for music .,POSITIVE
"I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I have another app open Spotify randomly stops, making me have to go to the app to get my music back, and whatever song it was on, even if it almost done, restarts. Other then that, spotify is great for listening to music, or podcasts!",POSITIVE
Once again Spotify isn't working properly. Sort it!,NEGATIVE
The app has been VERY glitchy the last 2 days. A developer needs to look at it.,NEGATIVE

Fabulous, back to not sleeping well. Upset because it's been fine for years. And now that I rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.",NEGATIVE
I enjoy all the podcasts,POSITIVE
Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,NEGATIVE

"Its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconet over and over. Enough with spotify.",NEGATIVE
Great song choices.,POSITIVE
Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.,NEGATIVE
"Well I do got to say had to change my mind at first I thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your Everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your SD card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** Spotify Spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%",NEGATIVE
Even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good,POSITIVE
"I really enjoy using this app, but I do have one suggestion. I'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. It'd make it much easier to look through my library. Still though, wonderful to use! <3",POSITIVE
l you can't cancel the subscription it gives you the runaround and I had to cancel my debit card over it,NEGATIVE
"I love the music added to this, except it keeps getting rid of some songs, some of them my favorites, but most of all, it makes me happy, especially the lofi.",POSITIVE
Wonderful music app. I love the new music Spotify finds for me. Thank you.,POSITIVE
"I like Spotify but when I use the app it tells me I have no play lists and all the play lists have nothing on them but when I use Spotify on the website I have 2 play lists and there is play lists, why is that?",NEGATIVE
Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.,NEGATIVE
"Overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. However the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, I can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.",NEGATIVE
"I love it on my Xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a Playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming service ever!!,POSITIVE
I love it the best music app thanks,POSITIVE
"Probably my most used app, I use it every day and have never not used it. Full ratings deserved",NEGATIVE
Spotify is a good music app not that many adds and I would really recommend it to my friends.,POSITIVE
Great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. But the fact that I can't listen to the song I want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. If you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.,NEGATIVE
The best app to listen to advertisements,POSITIVE
A Great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest,POSITIVE
I like the podcasts and I used to listen to audio books on you tube but I think I'll keep listening to spotify,POSITIVE
Why are literally all of your ads 3x louder than the songs stop,NEGATIVE
"Why this app getting worse! Songs playing and I can't see the player. I can't stop, skip, or do anything. Please fix it.",NEGATIVE
I get to listen to all my favorite bands it's amazing I love it and awesome ðŸ˜Ž too I'm a fan of bands so yeah!,POSITIVE
"This app is a must but the only thing I don't like it because there's too much of add. After playing one or two music ,there you can hear the sound of the add",NEGATIVE
"Good selection, not so good app.",NEGATIVE
Always great quality. Always works great.,POSITIVE
Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!,POSITIVE
"Haven't used this app for a very long time and I don't followed any changes, but before I was able to listen one song, I had to watch 8 (!) ads. Like 3 X 30 seconds and 5 X 15 seconds ad. The song was shorter than those ads",NEGATIVE
"Best music app ever, I used to spend 100 bucks a month on CDs but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music I would never have found! I LOVE YOU SPOTIFY ""PLATONIC OF COURSE""!",POSITIVE
"Great music app, premium is a must.",POSITIVE
"The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs",NEGATIVE
"Go to choice for podcasts and music, good app.",POSITIVE
"Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....",NEGATIVE
When I clicked on the songs I wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol I still recommend it to a lot of people,POSITIVE
"The app isn't working on my phone anymore (Samsung A20). It was working just fine before the more recent update, but now all the playlists are empty and I can't play a single song (and no, I don't have offline mode turned on).",NEGATIVE
"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",NEGATIVE
I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!,NEGATIVE
You're better off paying for youtube music. There is no way to cancel your account/subscription if you forgot any credentials like a password or user name. Have sent them several emails to attempt to cancel since you can't call them but there is no way to cancel because they say they can't find my account but they are charging me for it.,NEGATIVE
I switched to Spotify after Google discontinued play music and haven't regretted it.,POSITIVE
Seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade And stop complaining!!,NEGATIVE
"I love this app. However, recently it's been glitchy. I can't control the songs. The control features are gone. The app stops. Please fix soon.",NEGATIVE
Pretty awesome... I get to listen to music and stuff. You have to have premium if you don't wanna listen to ads every other song.,POSITIVE
So convenient and easy to use,POSITIVE
Very nice But innum songs add panuga,NEGATIVE
Continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. All other apps working.,NEGATIVE
I would have given it a 5out of 5 but not bc it don't let me replay a song,NEGATIVE
Spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my One plus 9R device. Requesting team to look into the same. It's more guess because of the recent OS update by one plus,NEGATIVE
"Great app, although it can be glitchy at times. Paying for premiums so worth it.",POSITIVE
"What's happened? I've been using Spotify for years with no problems. But now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so I can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. This app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality I feel I'm getting a poor deal.",NEGATIVE
"The worst app I've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips AN HOUR plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole Playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, I also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing I use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad",NEGATIVE
"I always used to like this app and it was my favourite app to listen music or podcasts to, but lately I can't really download anything even though I have plenty of storage left and the app keeps on stopping. I deleted the app multiple times and restarted my phone but nothing works and after the last update everything just got worse.",NEGATIVE
Excellent service with all chromecast devices,POSITIVE
"It's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.",NEGATIVE
"I will only rate 5 if you include option ""Set Music As"" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to music...you dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...I know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you not ""getting"" anything, you are enjoying music, and I guess you can just use the default like I do but it is just limiting. The app itself is great and has huge options and good quality, not glitchy and is great!",POSITIVE
Worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,NEGATIVE
"So far so good .... Came over from another streaming service and its only the first billing month , I have had no problems and the library is much better, lots more podcast to choose from and .... I dont even miss Neil Young âœŒ",NEGATIVE
"This is a bad app. Resso is much better than Spotify. A song is repeated over and over again. I wanted to give it zero star, but There is no system for that. I'm uninstalling it.",NEGATIVE
All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.,NEGATIVE
The app won't even launch on my phone Just keeps showing the Spotify logo I'm disappointed,NEGATIVE
Very good app but so many ads,POSITIVE
Spotify is the perfect name....spotty at best. I cant believe how many times the app plays music and sometimes it just doesnt want to. Mix that with zero phone support and fix the problem is a joke. I pay for this service for way to long now it just doesnt work at all. Ive looked at all forums and nothing has fixed the problem.,NEGATIVE
"Recently I've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. I normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. My most annoying issue though is that I can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. It kinda sucks right now considering I pay for premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10",NEGATIVE
"Best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that i was looking forward to listen sometime not available ðŸ˜¢",NEGATIVE
"Still buggy but functional. I still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. Beyond that, it's alright. Shuffle doesn't work properly. Will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement",NEGATIVE
"I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",NEGATIVE
It's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. It's so confusing,NEGATIVE
I spoke with customer service for hours about an issue I was having and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my phone model. If you have issues that are specific to a device you should clearly market it as such if you aren't going to fix it.,NEGATIVE
One of the best music app,POSITIVE
"My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.",POSITIVE
I find every song every time,POSITIVE
Damn My profile picture was in my Spotify and click man I love the playlist thank you so much,POSITIVE
Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.,POSITIVE
Awesome app that stays up to date with the latest rap and hip hop. My favorite app for music by far.....,POSITIVE
It is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song,NEGATIVE
Won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! So much fun,NEGATIVE
So bad. Ads that will lag your device [S10] and will pop up and start playing random song's at random times. Try YT music and audible The programs MUST be trolling.,NEGATIVE
I don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song,POSITIVE
Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to,NEGATIVE
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,NEGATIVE
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,POSITIVE
"It's been overall great improvement within couple of years and audio quality is great. The app synchronise between devices perfectly and I love this feature to switch between devices while playing song. I only thing I found weak is song suggestions, though I am using this app from couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which I like and groove. Please start using better AI so it can suggest and make better playlist for different users.",POSITIVE
how do i play a songinstead of a damn playlist..... please.. tell me.... i cant figure out after about an hour,NEGATIVE
Yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart,POSITIVE
It won't even load and that's very upsetting considering I was charged for it.,NEGATIVE
I might as well just totally discontinue usage of this service. I hope they didn't layoff good staff for high school interns.,NEGATIVE
"As of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. I have changed my review to reflect this change It is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the pop-up doesn't appear so I can't scroll in the song. I have to close the app to stop the music. While listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and I will have to start over. Due to bugs in the current update, I'm not able to fast forward to where I was.",NEGATIVE
"Great choice of music, easy to create playlist and music always at my fingertips ðŸ’ƒ",POSITIVE
I am thoroughly enjoying Spotify and the flexibility that I have with this streaming service to create Playlist of my favorite types of music.,POSITIVE
Spotify music player good app,POSITIVE
"I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",NEGATIVE
I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. Its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. Please fix it,NEGATIVE
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
"A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we download the lyrics please. Considering these minor things , Spotify is great app to listen to music",POSITIVE
I gat everything i need right on spotify..,NEGATIVE
You can find just about any song I don't get ads.,NEGATIVE
I would give this app five stars if it dinin't have so many ads,NEGATIVE
New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.,NEGATIVE
Really enjoy the music. No technical problems.,POSITIVE
I enjoy listening to my music in Spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your songs and get an ad interruption durning a song other wise I would've rate a 5 but I give you 3 rating it could be better,NEGATIVE
"Improve feature as like if u right swipe the playlist, they gets queued as well, just like songs",NEGATIVE
"Used for a year, and it's better than Pandora, however.. Missing the most basic feature, play history. This is why I refuse to pay. I use Pandora and Spotify to discover new music, and when I can't look up who just played, whats the point really? Edit: Still broken.",NEGATIVE
Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,POSITIVE
So many great songs to choose from!!,POSITIVE
"You guys should add JPop to the main genres on the menu, just as you've added Kpop.",NEGATIVE
"Using this every day, all the time. Subscription is worth it.",POSITIVE
This app is so hard to navigate on phone if I click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song I never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song,NEGATIVE
"Been a great experience, highly recommend.",POSITIVE
Great app for finding your favorite music,POSITIVE
App doesn't even open! Uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !,NEGATIVE
"Use to have beats that then turned in apple music,(which did not like at all) found out about Spotify and do not regret getting it.",POSITIVE
On my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. Podcasts drop off or the app crashes and I can't stop the track and Spotify doesn't remember were I was inside of the podcast. It's not usable.,NEGATIVE
Excellent choices in music based on my tastes,POSITIVE
"generally good (Spotify is a great service). removing a star because their team seems generally unwilling to listen to feedback from the user community. just go look at their help forums for tons of examples where an issue is reported, backed up by hundreds of users, but no indication they will work on it. please fix the shuffle algorithm! I have a 40 hour playlist but end up hearing the same songs every day.",NEGATIVE
"Endless issues, stops and/or starts without any reason, plays episodes I didn't request. Frequently stops and won't play at all. It's the worst of all the podcast players I use - I only use it because I can't get Rogan anywhere else. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan and the Dark Horse podcast, I'd dump it in a heartbeat and never miss it.",NEGATIVE
I love the Spotify app. Especially the lyrics feature...I can sing along!,POSITIVE
Love it!!! Great work out tool also.,POSITIVE
Definitely a good app for music or podcasts. The premium subscription thing is probably a bit overpriced though.,NEGATIVE
"Nothing. After I registered and pay premium mini I can't play or add, open profile of my account. How it this even possible? Plus daily mox from Spotify aslo marked as empty",NEGATIVE
I love that I can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.,POSITIVE
I enjoy spotify.every song I want it right here,POSITIVE
"Love it especially every favorite song i play, especially since I'm a huge music head.",POSITIVE
UI needs work (by that I mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song )so far so good tho,POSITIVE
"Very spotty servers, laggy mobile and desktop apps that crash and hang with no explaination despite top tier hardware. Catalog shrinking due to political and copywrite nonsense.",NEGATIVE
This is the worst podcast player. Everything is harder than it should be.,NEGATIVE
I loved when i downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. I can't even play i single song without buying it. It's really annoying! I loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...,NEGATIVE
I don't understand why Spotify needs my mic in order to work. Otherwise I have no trouble with the app.,NEGATIVE
It was a ok app didn't have it that long was use to pandora music playing guess I will try it again some day,NEGATIVE
"Best streaming music and podcast app. Especially if you like discovering new music, this app is for you.",POSITIVE
"Didn't think I would enjoy spotify, I couldn't have been more wrong. Dr",NEGATIVE
It's the best music app to listen to your favorites songs,POSITIVE
Everything works and sounds great.,POSITIVE
Good stuff on spotify,POSITIVE
It takes so long just to download,NEGATIVE
Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify yo listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but the Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!,NEGATIVE
This app is good but pls make an update where i can delete recent played pls PLSS I BEG YOU,NEGATIVE
"Long time user. Lately it's been full of glitches. Can't control the app, it always says Spotify is trying to play, it randomly pauses whatever you're listening to every few minutes. It's almost unusable right now. Its a shame because it's been my go to for so long ðŸ˜•",NEGATIVE
I love this app but when i try to listen to my fav song it puts something else that's why i am giving you 1 star make it ok please,POSITIVE
Love Spotify I recemend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend play list,POSITIVE
I just wish for better sound quality and a light mode option,NEGATIVE
I pay for Spotify premium now because I don't like ads but Amazon music was absolutely atrocious when it came to podcasts. I have had zero issues with Spotify at anytime for anything!,NEGATIVE
Easy to use enyable and entertainable,POSITIVE
"It works only when you open it, it's getting hard to use.",NEGATIVE
"30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)",NEGATIVE
Every time i wanna play a song. It plays the wrong song that i dont like. Please fix this,NEGATIVE
My favourite app. The perfect one. Love you Spotify ðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
A huge collection of music,POSITIVE
"Amazing for music. Glitchy and extremely unreliable for podcasts. Please fix it asap, Premium doesn't feel very premium anymore. Edit: One year later and the issue remains. 2 star becomes 1 star.",NEGATIVE
I've used spotify for years and have payed for premium for a few years now. Recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record. The problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on. I've tried all of the recommended fixes online. None of them have worked. If the problem persists I will be canceling my premium subscription.,NEGATIVE
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",NEGATIVE
"Very interesting! great format , real lovely",POSITIVE
Ever time I try to listen to a certain song it always play something different.,POSITIVE
Very good selection of music,POSITIVE
Wonderful songs apps,POSITIVE
Spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what I already listen to. Every music lover should have this app!,POSITIVE
"After few minues of installing the app, and after I opened it, I was surprised by the ammount of restrictions that you add to the app, to a level that you maked it dead. It is like someone is in a prison or detention. I hate how you put the users in this situation to pay premium which is not accepted. Although, if you would like to make the app better, at least show how it is cool and useful for at least the first few days, then I might think if maybe I would like to purchase the premium.",NEGATIVE
Just awesome and easy,POSITIVE
The fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. Because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. You can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advance do you want it to be.,NEGATIVE
i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try,POSITIVE
"Love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. Meaning I can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/",NEGATIVE
"I got Spotify premium but why can't I click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. Plz fix its annoying",NEGATIVE
"Best music app but it has flaws, im on android and if i plug in my headphones spotify automatically starts playing without me goig into the app. Another flaw is that its gonna play ads every 30 mins but its more like every 10 minutes. Great app overall tho",NEGATIVE
Spotify podcast suck so much a**. The absolute only reason I use it is to occasionally listen to Rogan... unfortunately it barely works. Spotify should gtfo of podcast because they can't even make a reliable podcast player... POS.,NEGATIVE
"My playlists are not on spotify mobile so I can't do anything on it. Linked account on laptop, etc work fine. Only mobile. 1 star.",NEGATIVE
Too many advertisements. Had to listen to 10 advertisements in a row before finally listening to some music,NEGATIVE
"Play bar disappears and you cannot skip or pause playing episode, only way it comes back is with a force close.",POSITIVE
Love using this podcast,POSITIVE
"You guys are making this app worst day by day. You need to understand what the users demand. Just don't think about your so called business. For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?",NEGATIVE
Spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!,POSITIVE
Why you added that hiding feature? Because it sucks when I want to unhide any song!,NEGATIVE
Fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use,POSITIVE
Well worth it for an infinity of songs and especially because there aren't any lame whining Canadian neil young songs...ðŸ¤£,POSITIVE
"Love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.",NEGATIVE
My music keeps stopping for no reason. The web player for computers is way better than the app.,NEGATIVE
You have to buy premium for the app to work correctly,NEGATIVE
Downloaded episodes don't play without internet. What's the point,POSITIVE
Best music player in the world love you spotify ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,POSITIVE
wowwwwwww one of the best audio play music platform i love it. awesome.,POSITIVE
"Moved to Deezer after constant skipping of tracks or restarting then , plus random shut down ..just because you are the largest streaming company does not mean you can provide a substandard app to your paying customer's, I would advise not starting a payment subscription right now as these issues have been going on for months , my subscription is now cancelled and I've moved to Deezer which is a far superior streaming service .",NEGATIVE
"I can't give this 5 stars because they took one of my absolute favorites (planet net, by the subdigitals) off here completelyðŸ˜”. But i'll give 4 for everything else",POSITIVE
"Great app for playing music, although when I search up a song I want to play, after all the adverts have played, I have to skip through multiple different songs and sometimes I don't have enough skips to get to the song I want so most of the time I go on yt and play it because I can't be bothered waiting for songs i don't know to finish playing!",POSITIVE
"I would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in tht(ex.korean,telugu) language only i mean english too and I took subcription of a week and it just wont let me see the download optionðŸ˜“",POSITIVE
Amazing app nd whatever song u searchðŸ”... U r gonna find it.... It's so flexible to use nd really good audioðŸ”Š quality ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"These new updates suck Are you going to fix the offline mode, because when i dont have data i want to open my downloaded playlist, an all i get is a black screen, i shouldnt need more data to play something that is already downloaded. For now im going to cancel my suscription, i dont want to live with this again, ill try youtube music",NEGATIVE
"Has been bugging out recently. Won't show what I'm playing, will randomly stop, isn't keeping track of playlists",NEGATIVE
It's pretty cool I like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still I like it,POSITIVE
When I try to watch a podcast using Spotify on my t.v it won't show me the image,NEGATIVE
"Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating.",NEGATIVE
"Covid spam, crashing, hard to navigate. Takes forever to load list of episodes. No fast forward. Buy premium to skip song lol.",NEGATIVE
This is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite Kaira l love *Spotify* Thank you *Spotify*for this you are amazing,POSITIVE
The hell is wrong with Spotify. It always play the wrong music,NEGATIVE
Why can't I use the app for a few days now? I tried uninstalling installing. Even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. I need to stream.,NEGATIVE
"The User Interface needs to be a little more usable when it comes to reporting songs with swear words in as some are missed. Also, they do not include certain swear words into the explicit category so I will often hear s*** in songs and no E next to them.",NEGATIVE
Best music app so far,POSITIVE
"Hi, I changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?",NEGATIVE
This is a AMAZING app and I feel that it has all of the songs I ever want to play and I am glad I downloaded it.,POSITIVE
Brilliant music experience.,POSITIVE
"I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",NEGATIVE
It's not opening. The app isn't opening,NEGATIVE
Best platform for streaming music tbh,POSITIVE
There is some bug that does not allow the songs to be played in the order it shows in the playlist. Please fix this,NEGATIVE
I have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,POSITIVE

"Nice app it's handy and most music is on it, you guys should add music soul mate.",POSITIVE
Good but please add an option to rearrange songs in our playlist again. Don't wanna open my PC and Google Chrome again and again just to do it.,NEGATIVE
App will not load just flashing Spotify symbol and no customer support to fix it. I've had it since Google music stopped 2 years ago. I've loved Spotify since but for the past week the app won't load. I've uninstalled and installed 90 times but still won't load. Spotify needs custom service and support. You don't value our money or membership if you can't provide that much,NEGATIVE
"A little pricey, but am enjoying it....",POSITIVE
Works fine most of the time,POSITIVE
Nice app for music,POSITIVE
It's the best music browser,POSITIVE
"it is a great app but it has a skip limit time now and it does not have the shuffle button anymore it does it automatically and if I click on a song it takes me to a different song that is not the one I chose, I will like to listen to my playlist in pieces ðŸ˜¤",NEGATIVE
Number 1 aap in all music apps,POSITIVE
"It's a good app, but I don't like how you have to get premium to unshuffle your playlists.",NEGATIVE
"Worst designed app I've ever used. Takes ages to load downloaded content, or to download content at all. Every page seems to take way too long to load. Get any other player.",NEGATIVE
Great and easy to find your music.,POSITIVE
Best music app no issues or any bugs,POSITIVE
"Great when it works, but crashes 30% of the time I try to use it, need to restart my phone just to get it to work again.",NEGATIVE
I love it soo ðŸ˜ðŸ’•much it feel very relief when you ðŸ˜Œlisten music But only problem is the adds,NEGATIVE
Fantastic and free!,POSITIVE
"I've seen worse UI and UX work on other apps, but not many.",NEGATIVE

Great music application ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Best music app ever â£â£â£,POSITIVE
"Premium user for 7 years but the app just does not work anymore! The play button is missing, and the app just stops working every 30 seconds when on mobile data!! What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am ""offline""!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed ðŸ˜ž. Im also looking into other music options now",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify! Not only for music but I listen to podcasts before I go to bed each night. It helps me drift off to sleep ðŸ˜´,NEGATIVE
The app is great. The experience so far has been top notch. Keep it up Spotify!,POSITIVE
The app is good only if you purchase premium.,POSITIVE
It's won't shuffle the songs I have in my library or my liked songs. Since the update it won't shuffle the songs.,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, but I've been having trouble using it since an Android update from a few days ago (I have a Samsung A50). I can't access any kind of media, whether it be albums, playlists, podcasts. All the songs have disappeared, but I still can see that the playlists (and so on) exists. Please fix this bug!!",NEGATIVE
It's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. You need to search them and then add them all one by one.,NEGATIVE
"*UPDATE* Still no response re my emails. So disappointed. Time to cancel services I think. The status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. I can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. I have emailed a help request twice now with no response. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've logged out and back in. Still nothing. For an app I pay a premium price for I would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.",NEGATIVE
Easy to navigate App with all your fav tunes,POSITIVE
Never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.,POSITIVE
Hlo Sir I am Spotify user sir I request your premium plan on payment method in play store i requested you pls open the service in play store payment pls i humble request,NEGATIVE
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.",NEGATIVE
Constant problems with this app for 2 straight years. All that money and can't put out a good app that simply works...,NEGATIVE
Great music. Easy to navigate.,POSITIVE
"I've had Spotify paid subscription for years and love the app, but ever since the last update it randomly stops showing the song that is playing as well as pause stop next etc and the only way to see it again is to reboot my device. Could you please look and fix this?",NEGATIVE
"First of all i have it for like 1year now and it super works but rights now It didn't let me in i tried to uninstall it but it still didn't, pls fix this",NEGATIVE
"Since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated Spotify app on my Pioneer Head unit, only through the phones Bluetooth. This has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. Please fix. Zero interest from Spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any customer service.",NEGATIVE
There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.,NEGATIVE
"I love it.... I will recommed this app for everyone to useâ™¡ i loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it it has a really few adds, you all guys know how irritating the adds areðŸ˜¢but you will not face that problem in spotifyðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘I loved your application.",POSITIVE
After using Spotify premium for 3 months it's nice but if you don't pay for it you will have a hell of a time doing anything on the app.,NEGATIVE
"Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",NEGATIVE
"I have to uninstall and reinstall this app every few days. Podcasts just randomly stop playing, even if I've downloaded them. Annoying.",NEGATIVE
It always tells me I am offline. I know I'm not because all my other apps work fine.,NEGATIVE
Good sound music any thing you want to listen to,POSITIVE
Awful app and service. No longer paying for premium as spotify simply does not work!,NEGATIVE
Excellent. Enjoying Spotify on phone & in car very much!,POSITIVE
"Terrible really. Slow to load menus, searches, library. Sometimes it wont even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. Even worse if it's in offline mode. Often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. Terrible app",NEGATIVE
Whenever I randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and I don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... It's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then I really have a very strong connection.... I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still same problem. It was making me sick.... I really hope that the developers see this issue and fix it..,NEGATIVE
I've always liked Spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes. The sele tion of available artists and songs is also awesome.,POSITIVE

Okay.... ; /",POSITIVE
"Love Spotify, couldn't imagine my life without it...:)",POSITIVE
Had a login on my Spotify so I changed the password and logged out of all accounts and it let me log back in on my laptop but for some reason it's just stuck on the logo screen on my phone and a lot of other people have that problem if they log out. Not really sure what to do. I uninstalled it and restarted my phone and it didn't work either.,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming app hands down,NEGATIVE
This app is the best music app I have ever used.,POSITIVE
This spotify music touches the very thougth in mind . A true experince to listen.,POSITIVE
"Absolutely perfect except for the fact that (without Premium) I can only replay songs from my personal playlists on my tablet. However, I can replay my songs that are on my daily mixes ;) Recently, however, Spotify has been messing with my phone. I know it is spotify because when I uninstall it, the stuff stops. Spotify, please stop pausing and skipping my music, stop pausing my YouTube videos and not letting me play them. Stop playing your music at random times when the app isn't even open.",NEGATIVE
Great content! Drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!,POSITIVE
Bad. For some strange reason my app is not working. I switched to premium and now the app just starts and shuts. Don't know if this issue is connected with my mobile or otherwise. Looking forward to hear from the technical team of Spotify thanks..,NEGATIVE

"I have purchased premium subscription to avoid ""ads"" but no use,waste of money,I am frustrated by ads....please don't waste ur money.....developers make improvement...other wise no use",NEGATIVE
I'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where I left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say I'm listening to anything and I'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it I'm sick of paying for broken,NEGATIVE
All of my favorite podcasts from all aspects of my recreational life to my professional life in one place.,POSITIVE
"Navigating Podcasts is such a hassle. You scroll down a podcast, find a podcast and add it to your playlist. Then it goes right to the top. So you have to scroll down again.",NEGATIVE
The amount of Ads after listening to 15 minutes of music is getting frustrating. I'm a free user but I feel like I'm bombarded with ads.,NEGATIVE
Very nice app for music lover,POSITIVE
great collection of music,POSITIVE
"Love it! â¤ i can find all of my music, podcasts, meditations in one place.",POSITIVE
The whole package is great. I would recommend this app to everyone,POSITIVE
"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",NEGATIVE
Great streaming app I use it everyday...ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
I didn't like/ I don't like the automatic update! & now (without premium) how to one song on repeat?! This new update/new version 8.7.44.968 is Sucks!ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Terrible app. Can't even play the song you want. When I click a song it plays something entirely different. You can't do anything about it unless you have premium or you use a computer,NEGATIVE
"Hi, I updated my app to the lastest version but I still have problems on lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!",NEGATIVE

"7/7/22 - The app had been working fine for a while, but is now suffering from the Samsung/Android issue. The playing now bar doesn't show up and the app stops playing randomly in the middle of songs and podcasts. 1/13/21 â€ I've been using Spotify for about a year now (with a paid account) but recently the app has stopped playing anything.

"Used to work great until the last update. Now their is no option to pause or resume music or podcast. The only way to pause is to completely close the app. This really sucks Spotify, as a premium customer I should have an option to pause not close the entire app. Please fix this!!!!",NEGATIVE
It's annoying when it crashes suddenly. Not that frequent but often enough to be annoying.,NEGATIVE
The best music service in the universe!!! 97 custom playlists and counting. Downloaded music is amazing. You customer service is the best. Nobody can match Spotify.,POSITIVE
"This software is really terrible. I can't get rid of the ""currently playing"" item and I can't get the sort to play podcasts starting at season 1 episode 1. How in the world can sucg basic software be so bad.",NEGATIVE

"Since last update the queue system is broken only lets you add one song to a queue and will frequently bug out and hide controls for currently playing podcasts and makes it impossible to pause it from the app. I dont know how you managed to ruin your qrues system more the YouTube music buy this is embarrassing, if this isn't fixed by next billing date I'll be forced to move platforms so that I can actually listen to my music and podcasts",NEGATIVE
"All the music I need, easy to access and organize an extensive library.",NEGATIVE
"For more than a week now i an unable tobdownload Spotify app on my Samsung A51. I have been in touch with the technical department and have done all the measures one can perform to fix the issue like deleting data n cache, clearing up storage and memory uninstall and reinstall thousands of time.

"Been using it for years, it's always been buggy and has gotten much worse lately. Quits playing in the middle of songs. Quits playing in the middle of podcasts. Doesn't realize it's currently playing a song or podcast. The podcast library and list are so inferior, no reasonable sorting algorithms or ability to manually put your podcasts in order. Yes, I'm even a paid subscriber with a family plan ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸",NEGATIVE

Its really good would want to listen to it more,POSITIVE
It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Don't even get me started on all the issue with Google maps app integration which makes for unsafe driving! Please contact me for more info!,NEGATIVE
The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app,NEGATIVE

I enjoy listening to my christian favorite songs,POSITIVE
excellent application more than the others.,POSITIVE
Your better off listening to music on YouTube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. The only reason I'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs I actually like so that way I can listen to them on YouTube. would not use again,NEGATIVE
Amazing music app,POSITIVE
Best Music Streaming App,POSITIVE

"Would rate better if I could choose the songs I'd actually want to listen to, the Xbox/Tablet/Web client are all far better than this junk.",NEGATIVE
"I don't know if this is a glitch, but I can't even choose the song I want to play when I want to listen to my playlist. It just plays some random song. I tried to play lofi music to relax and it played We Don't Talk About Bruno. Its kinda annoying that I have a small chance it'll ACTUALLY play the song I want. I'm still gonna keep trying though. I also keep getting ads for period pads which is kinda gross ðŸ¤¨",NEGATIVE
My spotify took too long to open. I tried clearing the data and cache but it still doesn't work and operate. Pls help fix this.,NEGATIVE
Stopps playing for no apparent reason. No more dropdown comands. Its still buggy which is kind off incredible for such a big company. Shame,POSITIVE
"If you want to discover new music than this app is for you. Because it will add to your Playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. I understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. If they fixed this I would like it more.",NEGATIVE
It's awesome having all the songs you can think of in 1 spot and the lyrics playing along is the best feature. Love it,POSITIVE
I ain't gonna buy premium try putting as much as advertisements u want!,NEGATIVE
It's a pretty good app to listen music on.,POSITIVE

This is good app and easy to use,POSITIVE
Luv this app but I found songs on youtub but aint on Spotify little confused bout that but over all luv itðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œ,NEGATIVE
It is a wonderful app. It has all. Kind of songs and can be operated on both PC and mobiles.,POSITIVE
"This app is easily the best music streaming app when you pay for premium. No ads, offline downloads, great recommendations, unbelievably high audio quality, and a very user friendly UI. Without premium, you have relentless ads, lesser audio quality, no offline downloads, you're not allowed to ever turn off shuffle play. I get most of these, but when you lock playing albums in order behind a paywall, I think you're getting a little money hungry. Just pay premium and you'll get your money's worth",POSITIVE
Fun fun fun!,POSITIVE
I just really like for the music,POSITIVE
It's bad in the sense because it provide all benefits just in the paid version. I mean to say some benefits also provide to the free version.,NEGATIVE
At first the app is good but now I can't play the full songs and the format has change which is very confusing. Plus it only plays the preview lol,NEGATIVE
Constantly cuts out podcasts and only shows playing song about half the time good for music but alot of bugs,NEGATIVE

did really like this app but for 4 or 5 days the app gets permanently stuck after repeatedly playing the same add (Clash Podcast) Has made a great app unusable - will revise stars if/when issue fixed,NEGATIVE
"Not reliable enough to pay for. If you're willing to put up with crashes and times where it just won't open, fine. Just don't pay for it expecting the paid subscription to change anything; it doesn't.",NEGATIVE
Inappropriate and irrelevant advertising that isn't kid friendly.,NEGATIVE

"Love the app, but the player bar on the bottom frequently disappears, leaving podcasts continually running without a way to control them unless I force stop & re-open the app. Will rate 5 stars when fixed.",NEGATIVE
Keeps putting a push in my notification area even though I blocked notifications. Uninstalled. Play Music is much better anyway.,NEGATIVE
"App takes forever to load...like over 1 min. Program is very slow to start playing, but works after. Don't know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog. I have my songs on an SD card.",NEGATIVE
Exploring n awesome experience,POSITIVE
Just awesome app for music lovers,POSITIVE
"I overall enjoy Spotify because I can download with premium. Sadly I can't play it on my phone right now because my phone updated and Spotify just has empty playlists and nothing works. It says I'm not connected to the internet and I am. I have done everything imaginable including deleting it, logging out, Etc and nothing is worked to fix it. I don't know if this is the phone update issue or Spotify hasn't caught up to the updates yet.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify has been extremely buggy on my Samsung S22+. The biggest problem is when I open Spotify, whatever was last playing or is currently playing is not displayed in the player. It's just missing. Closing and reopening Spotify used to fix that. Lately it will persist through attempts to fix it.

"Everything I'm looking for, an app worth listening to.",NEGATIVE
Well I love this app the platform is so accessible and easy but mainly if you have Spotify premium like if you don't have it you usually have to play an ad or a couple to play 1 song or it plays a song in the same genre. But with premium you can download songs for when your offline and no ads! It's amazing if you have premium,POSITIVE
It was a great app except now it cuts in and out sometimes for some reason. Sometimes it won't even play. Please fix this,NEGATIVE
If used properly. A great app to share with YOUR family and friends,POSITIVE

This app has been acting up lately pausing for long periods during podcasts and won't play via Bluetooth in my car.

There are some songs that aren't available on spotify that I feel should be there but overall Spotify is one of the best out there.,POSITIVE
We couldn't even download any music for free,NEGATIVE
"Linkable to many services and devices. Selections somewhat diverse. Convenient w/ offline DL's (paid)ã€ŠBUTã€‹Poor shuffle randomizer. Wasteful efforts on useless features, IE: Strange Things mode. I mean really? A feature only experienced on a single page? I mean, who watches the screen whILE LISTENING? even MTV learned that years ago. But the penultimate reason I can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of THE profits. SO Much so that many musicians boycott Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Way better than Apple music or Amazon music,POSITIVE
It wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,NEGATIVE
The play and pause button are not coming on.,NEGATIVE
Not displaying current song being played. Can't use on multiple devices at the same time.,NEGATIVE

The ads are too long..,NEGATIVE
Sometimes the playlist dornot opens and then again I have to download it or maybe update again after the given update.,NEGATIVE

Could the app be any more glitchy. Also if you could crash a little more than 2 to 3 times a day. That would be great. Thanks,POSITIVE
Nice app for song downloading....,POSITIVE
Bundle of collection and quality ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‡â£ï¸ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
I don't like this app cuz I play bad liar it open a wrong soundðŸ˜¢,NEGATIVE

Best free music streaming app ever!,POSITIVE
I have always loved the Spotify app. And I have always been impressed with the improvements made over the years. But here lately when I go to turn my volume up or down when I'm on the app. My phone bogs down and almost freezes. When it does this it won't let me do anything untill the volume slider is gone. It acts like I get 5fps when I hit my volume,NEGATIVE

I've been using spotify since I was 12 and it's been alright. The one thing I'd change is making people pay to get rid of ads.,NEGATIVE
"Having an issue where the app hides the ability to skip, pause and so on.",NEGATIVE
Easy to use but sound quality is so so,POSITIVE
100% has everything!,POSITIVE
The app is great. But I don't like how the playlist has to be shuffled. What if I want to listen to a particular song? I can only skip 6 times an hour. I really dislike that.,NEGATIVE
when you pick a song it doesn't play it but the next playlist please fix,NEGATIVE
Sometimes my spotify plays random music not in ny playlist,NEGATIVE
Constantly crashes. Won't resume the podcast I was listening to. Instead starts a random episode. Almost impossible to use.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is great. Great variety and easy to use. They provide a great amount of variety for music. Also the podcasts are vast.ots of options and things to learn.,POSITIVE
Deleted my account and still charged me for subscription that is so unfair and now I can't even unsubscribe,NEGATIVE
"So now we can't fast forward or rewind anything we are listening to? What happened to the little bar to do that with? Also even after the new update it still does not allow you to select the next track from the lock screen like a pop-up window. U have to fully unlock the phone to change the track, please fix issue it is very annoying having to unlock the phone to change the music.",NEGATIVE
Why are commercials being played in the middle of songs? Trash music app,NEGATIVE
Good music app. Missing some songs I love. Charged me wrong once.,NEGATIVE
Intermittent audio on all devices using Samsung phones (2 different models) and different BT devices. I uninstalled Spotify and then reinstalled. So far so good.

Great app for music.,POSITIVE

Stop telling me I might like podcasts. They. All. Suck.,NEGATIVE
5 stars WHEN it works. So glitchy following the latest updates- widget doesn't work; randomly stops playing; no control bar; can't stop or pause play without exiting app entirely; sometimes available for car sometimes not.,NEGATIVE
"Love it, though I wish the ads weren't so long, I'm too lazy to buy something to remove them, and they aren't that bad.",POSITIVE
Please add more items on profile & setting.,POSITIVE
"Whenever I open my Spotify it just freezes the moment where the logo shows up and becomes unresponsive at all. I tried unistalling it many times, cleared my caches, freed up some space on my phone and it still doesn't respond and just freezes the moment the logo shows up when you open the app. I logged out on my Spotify and it just happened all of a sudden, I'm disappointed.",NEGATIVE
"Worked perfectly until I started paying This app worked perfectly for years until I decided to try the free trail. Now my control bar has disappeared, my played podcasts are coming up as unplayed, I've lost podcasts I was subscribed to. I won't be renewing my subscription if the premium doesn't even work",NEGATIVE
App sucks and non functional. Monthly payments for this BS! If I'm paying money for something it should always be functional and bug free,NEGATIVE
Really enjoyed the free trial. Got my son to uograde his account to a premium family account,POSITIVE
I've used Spotify off and on for quite some time and I like it but if I had to say one thing negative I would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!,NEGATIVE
Please add the ability to play your whole playlist and not have to shuffle to different songs and add the ability to play your whole playlist on Alexa devices through the Alex skill please thank you so much.,POSITIVE

"Easy to use, nice that premium and paying in general is optional",POSITIVE
I love Spotify! I've had it for years and couldn't be any more pleased! Look out Pandora!,NEGATIVE
"When trying to listen to downloaded music offline the app endlessly buffers when you select your library, very frustrating.",NEGATIVE
"Very nicee but Someone hacked my account and every time it plays we're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. You know commitments what I'm thinkin of, you wouldnt get this from any other guy!â™¡ I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling",NEGATIVE
my spotify is not working,NEGATIVE
I can't even use the app. It loads up just the symbol then sits there and goes no where idk what the problem is and none of the trouble shooting tactics are working. I've payed for premium so shouldn't I get to use the F-ing app. I would do 0 outta 5 if I could.,NEGATIVE
App won't reflect my playlists. Has been updated. Won't let me update my screen name either. No available support for these issues either. Remind me why I pay for premium again?!,NEGATIVE
UPDATED: the recent Android version is very buggy. Random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. Seems to be a common new complaint,NEGATIVE
"#JRE is truly the only reason I use Spotify. Pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. Ads stink, especially the ads from Spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so I don't have to listen to ads.",NEGATIVE
It's a good music app but I wish the student discounts applied to high schoolers not just college.,POSITIVE
"Despite force stops, restarts and reinstalls, persistent problems of a disappearing play bar and playback randomly stopping. I recently got a Samsung phone and apparently this is a known problem. Please fix or I'll take my money elsewhere!",NEGATIVE
Completely bugged after update,NEGATIVE
"Wrong direction, this last update was the worst in several years. Broke all sorts of things in the Android app experience!",NEGATIVE
Not good l can't listen offline why can you make it possible,NEGATIVE
"The app keeps asking me to connect my devices(assume this is for data harvesting), why do I need to connect my device if it is already paired over BT? Debating on cancelling my membership and uninstalling if thos prompt persists.",NEGATIVE
Everything is good but this app shows tooooo much ads... It's just Irritating...,NEGATIVE
"Wish I could rate this junk lower. Garbage app, pauses, fails to load sometimes, full of ads, freezes, limited revenue for artists, trashy interface etc.",NEGATIVE
Mobile app is rather good but on wearOS the app is very limited. I can't even search for anything.,NEGATIVE
Stopped working after the most recent update won't even open 4 out of 5 times the one to two times it does open I get a blank screen the next time it opens I can't get into my library. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice I still can't get it to play every time I open it. As of July 1st 2022,NEGATIVE
Stop showing these BTS ads in background,NEGATIVE
Absolutely love this app. I have a very interesting fan light that has a Bluetooth and have paired my phone and able to pick out any song with guest and sing and dance with this ceiling fan that changes colors and has a speaker. Using Spotify puts so many genres at your fingertips to keep the party rocking!!!,POSITIVE
"I paid last month for Premium Family & my wife. Unfortunately she past away two weeks ago. Love the music, but I'll keep her phone too for when family come 5o visit.",NEGATIVE
I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,NEGATIVE
If there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players. Also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight? And the now playing bar doesn't always show up now and whatever is causing that also keeps me from controller music with my car or earbuds. Just don't be trash for 3 months straight. Dare ya,NEGATIVE
Handy in the car or in the shower for whatever music I'm feeling or cool podcast I want to discover. Can't imagine having to make do without it.,NEGATIVE
"Been away for a bit, app got worse! I seriously don't get how this can happen. Every time I open the app I get stuck in the ad loops! Like seriously how many ads do I have to listen to. I have to close the app and reopen it. Talk about making it so u subscribe. I'll definitely be finding another app. Horrible!",NEGATIVE
Songs stop playing randomly and over the last two days the player bar disappeared so I can't pause / skip / etc. I have to force close the app to make playback stop. Works again after I restarted phone.,NEGATIVE
"Cyber beggers, begging for premium subscription in between every songs.",NEGATIVE
I now can't pause music or podcasts. I don't know if there has been recent update but this has been happening since yesterday. I uninstalled the app yesterday then reinstalled this morning. Iwas working fine until now. Won't use app again. This is a pain in the neck.,NEGATIVE
"Was fine until like 6-9 months ago. Music player keeps disappearing, so I can't pause or skip through tracks correctly. This sometimes causes the music to stop randomly as well. Really frustrating. Using Samsung s10e",NEGATIVE
It would be really nice if Spotify could bring out the feature of using UPI for the subscriptions for premium like Netflix. This would really help people like me who wanna take out a subscription but don't have a visa card. Please do consider in the near future!,NEGATIVE
"Good music app! Sure, the Spotify premium only features are annoying, but it gives me music. It's functional, unlike Pandora. â­â­â­â­â­",POSITIVE
It reduces my storage to be fully songs that I can make a playlist n play it online ðŸ’¯,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify I use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life,POSITIVE

Great variety of music!,POSITIVE
"Really good to use, I've been using Spotify a lot in the last 2Â½ years, Haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)",NEGATIVE
"Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.",NEGATIVE
Awesome app but too many adds ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"Works fine on mobile, if I'm on WiFi no matter which one it just won't load anything, I tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!",NEGATIVE
Overall it is good but the only problem is that the ads. They just take to long for it to play the next song you want to play like 3-4 ads will happen in between of you listening to what you want to listen.,NEGATIVE
"won't let me play songs I want, and also shuffles songs when I want a specific song ALSO ALSO IT ""ADDS MUSIC I MIGHT LIKE"" I HATE IT, WHY CANT I HAVE JUST A FEW SONGS THAT I WANT",POSITIVE
"The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my ""Liked Songs"" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.",NEGATIVE
Amazing app for those who love music ðŸŽ¶.... But sometimes there will be some glitches... But not all the time ðŸ˜‰... If u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘.,POSITIVE
Best place to listen to music too!!,POSITIVE
Good content for podcast.,POSITIVE
"3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!",NEGATIVE
Excellent ðŸ‘Œ... Good for burning calories....,POSITIVE
I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon,NEGATIVE
I've had Spotify for about 5 years now and I'm a premium user I love the sound quality and the music they put on here the only problem which is why I'm give 4 stars is that it keeps glitching when I'm skipping songs it will either not play or keep going to the song previous or just skip 3 songs over other then that great app,NEGATIVE
App is amazing but after the recent update I'm unable to login to my profile. App won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. Hope they fix the bug ASAP,NEGATIVE
This app is worth its keep. Have enjoyed it so far. Hope they can improve on the sound output.,POSITIVE
"It's fun and free, but because of the auto shuffle I can't listen to a single song, even recommended songs I have to wait and listen to 5 other songs just to listen to a song I might not even like.",NEGATIVE
Very useful and enjoyable app.,POSITIVE
"I was once a deezer user but when i tried this app, I have been so addicted to music",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is great, I love it",POSITIVE
"Worked fantastic on mobile until recent update. It will take a short time to load (usually seamless), but then the controls do not appear after selecting a song. Don't know if that has to do with an ad that always plays? Can't see which one, no controls or album/ad view. After a few songs it will cut off. This time it crashed after 2 songs. Addendum: same issue with podcasts, even if an advert doesn't play first--no controls, cuts off unexpectedly. Happens on WiFi or cell data",NEGATIVE
"Hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? More like the Surprise me option in Netflix?",NEGATIVE
Very Good Music App,POSITIVE
Brilliant especially on Bluetooth,POSITIVE
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though.",NEGATIVE
Best music experience ever,POSITIVE
It adds songs that I don't want hear!,POSITIVE
"I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.",NEGATIVE
Any options left for students who cannot afford premium and have to deal with double unskippable ads?,NEGATIVE
Perfect music app!,POSITIVE
"Usually love Spotify, but recently been having problems with it! After about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. When opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. The other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? Something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.",NEGATIVE
Good music so many ads,POSITIVE

Suppper app. when I upset.and tired Just i listen the song's in this app.my mind is fulllll happy.and I realised my tensions. Thank u. Spotify.,POSITIVE
"The only issue I have is the gapless feature, it works on my phone really nice but when I transfer to my google speakers or in my car it doesn't work at all.",NEGATIVE
Some songs are unplayableðŸ˜’ Please introduce the light theme alsoðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
"I used to love it because I could play my favorite tracks anytime. The ads were annoying yet bearable. However, recently, I haven't been able to even open the app. Whenever I try to open Spotify, it just kicks me out. Currently I'm using an alternative. I might leave a better review next time if this is fixed.",NEGATIVE
When i share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image i can't delete that so please fix this problem asap,NEGATIVE

Just a very great app......love it and proudly recommend it too......there are ads but it's ok....np..this app has helped to overcome my sadness and also entertained me in every moment of life...,POSITIVE
WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE THING WHERE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC A BIT BEFORE PUTTING ON YOUR PLAYLIST,NEGATIVE
"Completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the app is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",POSITIVE
"App crashes constantly, the media bar disappears when playing music or podcasts and then I can't pause things, and the sound will randomly turn itself down while listing to music (not related to another notification appearing on the phone). This app is trash",NEGATIVE
It's a super cool app you will get all songs you want Tho it has add but still working amazingly well when you have low range,POSITIVE
"Recently had started stopping randomly when screen is locked. Also the play bar at the bottom disappears a lot of the time so the only way for me to stop a song is to shut down the entire app and start again. Lots of glitches, not great.",NEGATIVE
I totaly recommend you best music app ever its really worth it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Love this app it makes me feel better when se thing happened.,POSITIVE
I don't have any issues with this app at all really amazing,NEGATIVE
Good if you have premium without it it's kinda trash,NEGATIVE
"The App runs like a**. Every time I reopen it when I want to resume a podcast or song, der player disappears and the pages load for a minute or more. Every other app on my phone works fine.",NEGATIVE
I would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music,NEGATIVE
! It would be nice if one could sort the songs in one's own playlist manuel or after genres. -Sometimes I have the feeling that the app is a little bit buggy or weird because sometimes it doesn't let me put songs in repeat. +But all in one it's a nice app.,POSITIVE
This is very good AAP . I like this AAP very much . There all type of songs . Thanku so much for this AAP .,POSITIVE
You need to fix this I can't choose my own music and I have family premium... Fix this please,POSITIVE
Good sound quality â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
App works great!!!!,POSITIVE
Great app and Spotify is the best,POSITIVE
"Best App as it , Provides a wide range of Songs , BGMs and Also supported Background Music , But it will Be better if we can Clip from these songs And listen those clips",POSITIVE
Playlists are the same song you already have...... In a playlist.,NEGATIVE
Podcast video disappears randomly and doesn't show up even after force stopping the app. Terrible UI and I'm using android,NEGATIVE
This is amazing. I really like itðŸ’œðŸ’œ #spotifyðŸ’œðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
Spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks it previewed only I mean the song stops after 10 secs I tried really hard ðŸ˜… but it was broken,NEGATIVE
"I keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime I get discouraged. This time, I'm listening to podcast fine but I cannot pause it at all. The control to see what I'm playing is not there. Only way to stop it is to force stop it. I'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. Also, the controls don't translate to my car when I connect over Bluetooth. I'll update when these aren't issues.",NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, especially how it suggests other songs when I'm editing a playlist.",POSITIVE
"why won't it let me in? it's been like this for two days, fix it.",NEGATIVE
"Would not open no matter what I tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( It was pretty good when it did work.",NEGATIVE
"It sure has improved a lot compared to the earlier days, however I would love to see a better pricing policy for me to opt in and avoid the adds.",POSITIVE
"Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""Offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.",NEGATIVE
You can find amazing songs!You can find ur favourite artist,POSITIVE
"Please fix the dozens of bugs. Shocking experience. Now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. Had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. I live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on WiFi. For a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
"Pretty good, like the recommendations but now my playlists are buried under other stuff unless I click for only my composed playlists. I do love some of the suggestions made by Spotify.",NEGATIVE
"I searched for a song appeared, when playing it not the song I've searched ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",NEGATIVE
It has all the good music i like,POSITIVE
I love Spotify!!,POSITIVE
Everything is good I really like this app But there's one thing Why isn't canvas available in Nepal ?? Please make sure canvas is available in Nepal too.,POSITIVE
I really love this app I literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. For some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when I try to press play it won't so I have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.,NEGATIVE
Wonderful app! You can play music offline even without premium. The only problem is that there are too many ads.,POSITIVE
Great songs from this app.,POSITIVE
I know a lot of apps do this now. But Spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when Spotify failed to get payment.,NEGATIVE
Had no probs for so many years in my Android phone but now idk why but my Spotify doesn't lauch its always hanged on a black screen.,NEGATIVE
"I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons. I was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. Or I didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen.",NEGATIVE
"I love it! Would give it 5 stars, but I have to undownload it once and a while because the app wont show the song I am listening too.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent app. Love the music variety to listen to. Not having app issues.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ *(edit) this last update is bad, I need to hear 3 ads before I GET a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen the one I want, if I am lucky I can listen to that song after 6 skips. It shuffles the songs. Total stars goes down to 2 ðŸŒŸ.*",NEGATIVE
"Good appp for music listeners. However, please stop adding other kinds of music in my playlist. It's not a good option...",NEGATIVE
Awesome great for downloading tracks and albums would totally recommend for all ages. Just think it uses too much space. Recently it has been occasionally crashing or stopping music. But other then that its a great app.,POSITIVE
App is not opening.. I have installed it several times still the issue isn't fixed..,NEGATIVE
Got some bugs going on. Had to Uninstall cuz the app went into possessed mode.... I was watching a movie when out of no where music started interrupting...,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify!,POSITIVE
"App frequently clears my queue with no warning, repeats the same song 10+ times, breaks my playlists",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify soo much I love music so that makes sense but I can't afford to have premium so if u want to play whatever song u want without worrying about your skips have Spotify on a tablet or I pad and u can just pick what song u want out of your play list if that makes sense,NEGATIVE
"Songs clarity superb, good app to hear all journals of music.",POSITIVE
"Urgent Requirement! âš ï¸ You must add the ""download music option"" in tha application. Although downloads remain close inside the application. But it should me in free mode.",NEGATIVE
"It is cool and good songs are there,no ads and no advisement,are there app is excellent.",POSITIVE
Very nice music experience thanku for Spotify,POSITIVE
"I cant even listen to my own songs, last time you can but now you can't, this app sucks",NEGATIVE
Absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play I installed it just so I don't have to install songs and I don't want to pay just to listen to the song that I want to :(,NEGATIVE
The app is super awesome... i got no complains... I'm so so happy... Some songs don't have lyrics i think they have to sort that out but so far so goodðŸ‘ðŸ¾,POSITIVE
Spotify is really great. I love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is crazy. I only listen to Spotify songs and it's so AMAZING!!!,POSITIVE
"Free version is garbage! I do not mind an ad every few songs. The free version adds songs to your playlists. Can not skip them. You can not play individual songs, shuffle play only. You can only skip 6 songs per hour. Uninstalled",NEGATIVE
Great app for music,POSITIVE
More and more if u buy premium and if it's end u more ads,NEGATIVE
The quality is good but the only problem is adds .... It contains a lot of adds plzz remove the adds,NEGATIVE
"Playing meditation music at night - cuts off after 30 seconds. During the day, can drive 8hrs and not have it cut off. Adjusted all the settings so that it has full background access, no luck. Super disappointed.",NEGATIVE
App having nice song collection But the app shows partiality in treating languages. When hearing Hindi songs lyrics comes in Hindi script However while hearing Tamil songs lyrics comes in English script. If Tamil songs lyrics also comes in Tamil script. It will be ðŸ˜Š.,POSITIVE
Amazing app always calms my mood after a long streeful day ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
This app gets really annoying when I try open it it never actually opens properly and it takes me an hour just to open it don't recommend,NEGATIVE
"Used to be a great app. But now if you're a Samsung Galaxy user there is no more visible player. Which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. It also now crashes regularly. I've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. It would be useful if Spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. Update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in July 2022.",NEGATIVE
"It's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying",NEGATIVE
Why don't you just play ads instead of songs?,NEGATIVE
"Worst app, if you want to listen ads thn listen sportify, but if you are interested in songs thn plz find another app",NEGATIVE
Good music app i like it,POSITIVE
Some time only lag.............,NEGATIVE
Why my spotify error when i want to log out. I have try to uninstall and install it again but this app can't fix. Please help me to fix the appðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
I'm unable to open app. If I go onto the internet I'm able to view my Playlist however I can't click on the app itself to take me there anymore which is frustrating.,NEGATIVE
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,NEGATIVE
"I dont know whether i am using this app for listening music or listening to adds!! After ever 60 seconds of addd, if i change the 2-3 song quickly, it gives the yt shorts add again withing fur seconds.. it seems like i would have to uninstall this app. Cause its really annoying.",NEGATIVE
The new update is not the best it doesn't let u listen to the music u like,NEGATIVE
I mostly enjoy the app. I have over 4000 songs downloaded. Recently the option to shuffle play has disappeared and it plays the same songs over and over. I knew that I can make playlists but again it's the same thing over and over.,NEGATIVE
The pc spotify version is greater than this version. It doesn't need premium to skip/unshuffle the songs,POSITIVE
"I've been using it for years, but I started having issues with my downloaded songs during these past weeks. The songs get stuck at 4seconds in and won't load. Even if they are downloaded. I'm now trying to uninstall and reinstall it ..",NEGATIVE
I rate this 1 star bc when I play my favorite song it keeps playing on different song which making me hate this app. Plss fix this,NEGATIVE

"i cant open this app no matter what, its stuck literally and the worst thing is 8 have paid for premium, i have paid and cant use it just because this stupid app just dont responds. i have tried restart, reinstall and everything btw this sucks!",NEGATIVE
It's Spotify. There's nothing bad about it,POSITIVE
Its a very very good up I can't complain with it but the problem is the ad's I know you can buy premium but it's kinda annoying every 30 minutes to have a 30sec ad maybe do it every hour or something like that,NEGATIVE
"This app is perfect but i giving 3 stars because the many songs i search was not found by spotify. The soundcloud was the best it have every song when i search. Please add the turkish,arabic and remix lofi it is miss in spotify. Please fix it and add. Thanks",POSITIVE
"3 ads per skip is bollocks when the chance of hearing the song you requested is already a 1/5 gamble unless they like what you request. Sepultura, slayer",NEGATIVE
Still learning to navigate the programming. Guess I have to go to Premium because the commercials are annoying,NEGATIVE
"App crashes every all the time. And ad plays, it crashes. You switch to another app and comeback to spotify, app crashes. Always have to restart the app.",NEGATIVE
"I cant skip songs now, i got only 6 skips per hour. Like what the hell bro? I just want to listen to music normally, not to wait until song end. Im not using this anymore sorry guys",NEGATIVE
After every single song it plays add n they r heavily annoying even after update they haven't realized its annoying to keep such thing they removed the feature 30min ad free after a video add better to see other option,NEGATIVE
"It doesn't play the music I like, it doesn't leave my main screen. I just hate it",NEGATIVE
"I like how I can play any songs I want, although it can only be 6 skips.",POSITIVE
I love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this allðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡,POSITIVE

some other songs are not available like BTS song and other Things is ok Please sort out this thing why BTS Songs is not available,NEGATIVE

This app is getting worse It's meant to be free and you get 30 minutes without no adverts And I am still getting 6 adverts I can only listen to music for 15 minutes it for 15 minutes then I get more adverts,NEGATIVE
"I love spotify, I listen to the podcast and I listen to a ton of music, I have over 2,000 songs saved and I have a premium account and have had one for a while, would recommend Spotify to anyone and I do.",POSITIVE
The app has been great however recently when l search a song it plays a totally different song from the one l choose.,POSITIVE
Good music listing app,POSITIVE
"I used to LOVE the app but now all my downloaded songs are u downloaded and I had to download them again BUT I can't I tried several times but it just won't download again so I tried downloading other songs abd again no luck! I have premium so I can't say sth about skipping and stuff but I think that since the last hupdate Spotify is just ðŸ’©. It's lagging 24/7, and I can't even listen to music offline cuz it just won't play. Please fix those issues Spotify!!",NEGATIVE
This aap is so cool i find any song on this ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"The apps doing really good on my end, although when I exit and play a song when I get back on the song doesn't show on the bottom. I wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library. Other than that I still love Spotify<3",POSITIVE
Mine is not connecting with the internet and i just subscribe to premium my App is crashing,NEGATIVE
Best App ever created in this world 5 star without any doubt.....if u have a doubt then go duck yourself... thanks...,POSITIVE
Idk what you guys did with the interface but it feels like i have less control.,NEGATIVE
"Very rare to not find a song I'm looking for.....it happens, but not often. Even obscure music is available, I love that the lyrics are offered with most songs.... I'll never not have Spotify",POSITIVE
"This app has major link and playback issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. This is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it.",NEGATIVE
I Really Love Spotify But app it's not working please fix it,NEGATIVE
"Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.",NEGATIVE
"Along with the wrapped for a year, Spotify should also give the count for the number of ads given per year . Other than the too many ads , it is good for listening to music",POSITIVE
Exilent sound full HD .. No ads problem.. I love Spotify... Friends download this app without any doubt .. it's my opinion sarojsk,POSITIVE
"This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps them download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged",POSITIVE
"No Auto Artist and Album List. It is should be all about the songs. If I like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.",NEGATIVE
I was happy with the app because it holds all the artists I like with very few gaps. Until I bought Bluetooth phones and discovered that it constantly stutters audio playback - the only app to do so. There's a very long discussion thread on the Spotify community going back to April 2017 with a multitude of other users who never found a solution. Some resorted to the competition because the company clearly doesn't care. I'm also considering that.,NEGATIVE
"It's a nice music app but then when I play a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which I find annoying. I just want to listen to the songs I added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.",NEGATIVE
"Upd: watch your language Spotify and don't command me like that: ""Update your payment methods NOW!"". I won't update anything if I don't want to. I'm tired that I can't add to blacklist ONE specific track from recommendations/radios. I block it every day and Spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. It's hard to reorder playlist in Android app.",NEGATIVE
I am giving you 2 stars . Songs are definitely cool with good quality but your advertisement are too much long I use YouTube because we can skip in 5 sec but your ads are too long ðŸ˜‘,NEGATIVE
"I've been using this app since it come about and have always had premium and in recent years it's just getting worse an worse, what is the need to redownload the same song every day Spotify?! I hardly pick new songs to go into my playlists and every single day the app is downloading said playlist for offline use. then taking extra long to search or even add to que, I never complain about apps but this is by far becoming one of the most unreliable apps for music.",NEGATIVE
"I can't listen to what I want, why shuffling songs in an album or playlist against my will ? Damn! Pls fix this..",NEGATIVE
"Amazing user interface, I'm able to listen to my favorite music and podcasts. Awesome app",POSITIVE
It's good till it gets glitches.,POSITIVE
Very good app for streming music,POSITIVE
"Easiest and most convenient way for a student to stream music, but the app can be considerably buggy on my Samsung S8 *edit* Bugs still persist on Samsung S21.",NEGATIVE
They remove all the good song. Stupidify!,NEGATIVE
Download Spotify mod apks instead of real apk...we are here to listen music not ads,NEGATIVE
"I love listening songðŸŽ§ This app is soooooooooo perfect I am from West Bengal I listen hindi , English, Bengali, arabaic all songs",POSITIVE
I dont know what's happening because my Spotify won't log in and not opening as well when I'm using my data. I got an error always!,NEGATIVE
The now playing bar has disappeared,NEGATIVE
the app is very easy to use and it sounds great! my problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in my all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it.,NEGATIVE
"Amazing app for songs, It's one of the best I've used of all for music...... there are just too many ads but everything is exceptional and premium was also good.",POSITIVE
Nice sound quality,POSITIVE
Awesome app with not just music but valuable podcasts.,POSITIVE
"I've used spotify for years, it works without issue, and there's loads of brilliant user submitted playlists to choose from. There is ads every so often but you can go ad free, if you prefer. Unlike youtube you can close the screen with your music or podcast playing in the background, which is why its my music app of choice.",NEGATIVE
":) would be cool if everyone gets the premium package so everyone can use the account instead of just for 1 person, and with the discount price of a student. Music is life.",NEGATIVE
It is the best music app I have ever seen..,POSITIVE
Love Spotify music.,POSITIVE
"This app is good... I don't know why there is no older songs like 80-90s songs and famous songs like boys, visvasam,sivaji movies and so on .so pls add some Tamil songs from 2000-2021 and also recent movies songs",POSITIVE
"Hi Spotify devs, I like using Spotify but as of late the app has been unresponsive. I logged out of my Spotify account and since then the app would open but I wouldn't be able to login or access the homepage or anything. The app stays stuck on a screen just showing the Spotify logo. Can someone help me fix this please",NEGATIVE
"this app was really good but the new update ruin the app, I just can play the song that I want for a second. please fix it, thanks.",NEGATIVE
"Far too many ads, basic things that should be free such as playing a singular song you want to listen to. You have to pay for",NEGATIVE
"I accidentally delete the spotify data, yeah that's my fault. But I try to reinstall it and now I just stuck in the logo loading screen",NEGATIVE
I like the app but the shuffle option is disturbing pls remove it,NEGATIVE
Very addective and super play list,POSITIVE
Its an easier way to listen to music! It's honestly better than listening to music on YouTube. I love this!,POSITIVE
It's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,POSITIVE
I love this app but the new update is annoying. I know that's on purpose to make us buy premium. Giving us ads is enough. Not allowing us to choose or change the music and making shuffle disabled for us is annoying. I'll still give it a 4/5 cause I've been using this app for years already but I just haven't bought the premium.,NEGATIVE
Googd app Advertisments tloud.... Much too loud Speaker volume to 50% but advertisments are 80%-90% or louder Too bad,NEGATIVE
"I've been using for 5 years , it's awesome , it's an app that I use daily, I've been using premium for a long time and I have absolutely no regrets , money well spent .",POSITIVE
It's really ok and impacting but not all needed are available on Spotify.,POSITIVE
Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,POSITIVE
The pause play bar has gone missing! Please can this be looked at. Perhaps something weird in the last update?,NEGATIVE
Had this since 2014. I just HATE that the shuffle songs repeat. It's shuffled but in the same pattern every time,NEGATIVE
I would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads,NEGATIVE
"I really liked this application and I advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when I want to listen to songs without the Internet, I can not, but the application is still very good ðŸ˜â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",POSITIVE
"Cuberstalers, cgberbullies, narcissistic hackers BFF. The whole guns don't kill people people kill people Vail to hide behind. It's a good thing your not spinach then you can be recalled.",POSITIVE
"Terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that I haven't payed they won't even let me in the app to select what Playlist I'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay em or 2) cancel which I don't wanna do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. TERRIBLE STREAMING SERVICE!!!!",NEGATIVE
I love this app so much I have no problems with it,POSITIVE
Basic features such as playing things in order are unavailable without paying,NEGATIVE
Wonderful! Keeps me upbeat when I need it,POSITIVE
After getting the premium my life became to ease up a bit and I thank spotify ðŸ™ðŸ¾,POSITIVE
It is very good app but it's new update is very very bad I am deleting this app ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,NEGATIVE
"Used to be amazing, have been a premium subscriber for 3 + years. The latest update causes Spotify not to show the song playing so I can't skip etc. Will stop at random intervals so have to manually open phone again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still persists.",NEGATIVE
I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience,POSITIVE
So it's great but I sort of miss PandÃ·/ra. Spotify is awesome; however it's not life I've ever been to Vietnam. I got phished! Be careful.,POSITIVE
Very irritating. I want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... Furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. Please check on that as soon as you can.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is literally the worst platform you could use to listen to podcasts. They insert ads that aren't associated with the podcast makers and it makes podcasts sound disjointed. Premium doesn't even help in that regard. Some podcast episodes are also missing random 20 second snippets of audio, which aren't missing on other platforms so this is on Spotify's end. Most likely some kind of bug related to the aforementioned ads inserted into episodes by Spotify themselves.",NEGATIVE
"The app sound is amazing,i using some time",POSITIVE
Spotify are tha best any music you have all thanks,POSITIVE
"Best app to listen to your favourite music anytime ,anywhere.",POSITIVE
Why don't you guys add a minus one feature for every song. Like a karaoke. Since you already have lyrics on some songs.,NEGATIVE
Auto play random songs. It is non sense frustrating. I have set auto play off and it still skip and plays random stuff. Utter garbage. Good quality in song is not answer to the random song recommendation.,NEGATIVE
Now this aap is vary vary bad I don't like it because any song if I play this is no playðŸ–¤ðŸ¤®ðŸ’©ðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤¬,NEGATIVE
"July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode.",NEGATIVE
Awesome reference to my favorite tunes,POSITIVE
Full with Entertainment,POSITIVE
Its good and choice in your hands.....,POSITIVE

Spotify is wow I love it and I will recommend people to use it,POSITIVE
"Best ever music app i ever experienced is spotify. Never witnessed any song unavailable and that's the best thing about it. But still , in offline music(without premium) ,it include lot of ads which can be considered as "" excess"".",NEGATIVE
I love this app so much I love the music and everything about it. The podcats I really enjoy it's really interesting.,POSITIVE
"Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing experience! All the songs and albums, whether local or international, for last 30 years I've been enjoying...are now at my fingertips at the highest quality...thanks to Spotify.",POSITIVE
"This gives me the ability to play any genre of music I choose and I can literally DJ on the go , love it",POSITIVE
"Great app, use it every day",POSITIVE
"The problem is just becoming more unstable Like I used to use this app and other app at same time in past it used to work better but now it's stops on one song only I don't know why it stops And I updated the version again but here again that problem and again when I search for some songs the songs be like something went wrong, no internet connection etc and all Please if this continues I will not put for any premium package more I",NEGATIVE

Great music app. God bless you all. Christ Jesus loves you.,POSITIVE
I love this app to listen songs,POSITIVE
"Stops playing every ten minutes +/- I love to listen to my podcasts while driving is during my train commute, but the recent update constantly interrupts playback, so I'll uninstall for now. It's a brilliant app otherwise.",POSITIVE
Mind blowing app so easy to use and it's amazing ðŸ˜‰â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"The only place where I can get both music and podcasts. Great! I would not live without it. The only reason I do not have premium anymore is that I have got another music streaming service through my phone subscribtion - if I had not, I would definitely still subscribe to Spotify. Edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? That would be nice.",NEGATIVE
All those months it not work and they have not fix this issue if I play A song it will randomly play a random song please fix this again and the next update ok manager and developer ðŸ˜¤,NEGATIVE
I have installed in my android tv but whenever i play it the tv hangs and there is no problem with the apps even though i update the spotify on time,NEGATIVE

"I really enjoy spotify premium and have so for the last few years as a subscriber. After recently updating my phone, my spotify no longer plays anything. All my saved data is gone.

"It's been glitchy lately and music skips like scratched CD. And today, when I tried opening the app, it stayed at the logo and wouldn't load. I tried uninstall and install again, restarting my phone doesn't work either.",NEGATIVE
"Somehow varying streaming quality, maybe due to connection ...",NEGATIVE
The only god thing is that you can share instagram stories with that pretty lyric thing and that's it,NEGATIVE
Crashing and closing all the time,POSITIVE
Too much ads ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,NEGATIVE
"Been going downhill for years (the UI to find anything is terrible, sound quality is average and when you download something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without an Internet connection is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for albums I've downloaded. I've downloaded them because I'm travelling and I know my connection is going to be bad so why am I staring at a loading screen",NEGATIVE
It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's stupid,NEGATIVE
"Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",POSITIVE
"Never a boring moment with Spotify,search it you will find itðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
I've been using this app for years but recently Somethings up with the app please fix it. Sometimes the music just starts playing but there is no way to stop it. I can't get the album cover of song I'm listening up. There has been other issues are a recent thing. Please fix it,NEGATIVE
"they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.",POSITIVE
Can't open the app anymore,NEGATIVE
Very interesting app for music lovers,POSITIVE
Great! Only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesn't do that often,NEGATIVE
Fantastic music from top stars always available.,POSITIVE
"Recently the app has been randomly losing the player. Can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. Argh! Been using the app for years and have loved it. This needs to be fixed - please! Update July 5, 2022 Seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. Am un-installing and re-installing.",POSITIVE
Awesome app ðŸ‘Œ no ads,POSITIVE
Best choice for listening music,POSITIVE
what does it mean First you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again It would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,NEGATIVE
It would be nice if we can download music and listen offline,NEGATIVE
"The mobile version is absolute thrash I can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist with full of songs that i don't like.",NEGATIVE
This app is great. It has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! ðŸ•º,POSITIVE
"The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDAT: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this sub???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.",NEGATIVE
"What is going on with all the bugs? Spotiy has always been wonderful until the last few months. Bugs, skips, doesn't pop up what im currently listening to, so I can't pause or stop the music without having to close the app. I'm really hoping this gets fixed and I dont have to cancel my subscription â˜¹ï¸",NEGATIVE
It says ad free music ad free music only in between ads ðŸ’¥ðŸ”ªðŸ”ªðŸ”ªðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE

Best free streaming app,POSITIVE
All I know now is Spotify âœ¨ðŸ¤§,NEGATIVE
"In general the app is good, but recently when I play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, I also can't unhide songs. Please fix these issues.",NEGATIVE
"unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly",NEGATIVE
Very nice app to listen to your favorite artist,POSITIVE
"Spotify is great except two things. #1, It would be so much funner if it notified you when people followed you or notifed others when you follow them, I'm following countless friends who have no idea. It could be so much better. And #2, if you don't pay you lose access to listening to your Playlists, YouTube music still let's you listen to your Playlists when you don't pay, the only difference is having ads or not having ads. I hate that Spotify cuts you off.",NEGATIVE
App works great. Many features.,POSITIVE
"Now playlist only can be played, but didnt show the list so i cant skip any song i want to hear. Sometimes i want to hear song i like in the playlist multiple time.",NEGATIVE
"I love spotify. I can create my own playlists, and just listen for hours.",POSITIVE
Had Spotify for around 10 years planning on going another 10.,NEGATIVE
"its a good app, good music, but the new update is horrible. Why do i have to shuffle my liked songs just to listen to music? why cant i tap on the song to listen to the full song and not a sample of the song? it doesn't really make sense but it does what its supposed to do which is play music. Also the ads make me feel like i have malware on my phone with it popping up randomly.",NEGATIVE
Great choices of music and seem to be for Free Speech so you get 5* from me boo,NEGATIVE
Stopps playing playlists after just a few minutes,NEGATIVE
I am fine without needing to pay for music so I get ads but I hate everything else. I should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album Suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so HOW DO I HAVE NO SKIPS They have fixed all this so ya use spotify,NEGATIVE
"Love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. I also Love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.",POSITIVE
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.",NEGATIVE
Its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.,NEGATIVE
"In first time, this app is disatified for me. I try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in,Log in with facebook, Log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. What a uselsss app.",NEGATIVE
Im stuck at loading screen,NEGATIVE
I have never been happier with a music provider. i Tuned out after 10 years and literally thousands of dollars. It will take me the rest of my life of ALL available music to make up for it.,POSITIVE
"it literally is stuck on the logo and wont let me play my songs, go to home page or anywhere its just stuck at the logo.",NEGATIVE
This is a grate app for music streaming.,NEGATIVE
Used to like it but now you have to pay for basic fetures. You are forced to listen to random songs even if your trying to listen to one song. Its annoying.,NEGATIVE
The computer version is way better,POSITIVE
In my opinion spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.........,POSITIVE
Removed features being used by the client base without any notice. Rather go to YouTube music then continue paying Spotify money. Bring back Spotify connect function and I'll take my review back.,NEGATIVE
"The Reason for less stars is the ads are becoming irritating. This app used to be having a non interrupting playback for 30 minutes or so if you saw an ad between. But now it have ads after almost every songs. And it used to have an option for checking the song by giving a 10 second or so sample of it before adding the song to a playlist if you add the songs by ""Add Songs"" option in the playlist. Now it doesn't work. Please bring it back. And Please Allow us to rearrange the songs in a playlist",NEGATIVE
I don't know I if it's just me but every time I play my LIKE songs it will play but later I will play song that I never liked or is interested in ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬,POSITIVE
"This app is soo goodd i can listen to fav songs, and im not gonna find or download it in google or anything, i can just find it in spotifyðŸ¤ðŸ§¡ðŸ”¥",NEGATIVE
Very good I like all music is nice,POSITIVE
It a good app BUT how can I not pick the songs I want to play and only get 6 SKIPS AN HOUR it's so annoying why can't I pick my own songs. So after 6 skips your stuck listening to songs I don't want to listen to at the moment why can't I pick the song like on every other device,NEGATIVE
Too much ads ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,NEGATIVE
"Love you all except when the ads come in, then I just want to storm your office and dump your servers into the sea. ðŸ’›",NEGATIVE
I would give this 5 stars but the fact that you cant choose wich songs you want is dumb af.,NEGATIVE

Ads are good bcs tells abt new songs which are beautiful but smtimes it's is not good bcs u r listening ur fvrt song,NEGATIVE
"Good app, however, every time i want to add a specific song to my playlist, it shows me recommend songs rather than the song i want to look at and add. Edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. Wost music app ever. Uninstall and move to youtube people.",POSITIVE
I pick a song it will change into random music,NEGATIVE
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,NEGATIVE
Great app when it works. I've tried multiple times to get it to stop playing in the background to no avail. Next option is to just delete it and cancel subscription.,NEGATIVE
App is hot garbage and has been for years. I pay for the service and am plagued by crashes and random stoppages. Persistent notification for playback will break for no reason. Downloads will corrupt and leave you with no offline music.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features I have never seen before ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„âœŒï¸,POSITIVE
"I like this app but I hate it when we only get six skips per hour ,and when there is a song I did not put in my Playlist, I really hope that changes but overall is still good",POSITIVE
"Since June I've been having lots of problems with my podcasts and songs suddenly I'm playing and It stops and I can't press stop the songs, this is really incovenience, please try to fix this ASAP this is really annoying.",NEGATIVE
It's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4. Or 3 songs #2 it skips randomly for no reason #3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope it's the first one Here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes,NEGATIVE
All good. I've been with them for years . One time couldn't pay my bill on time. And they paid for 2 months. Do I half to say anymore. Thank u. . J bird.,POSITIVE
Way too many ads. Plays 1 or 2 songs and then multiple ads then does it again. Very annoying when trying to listen to music.,NEGATIVE
I haven't been able to enjoy music on any other app like I am this one (Spotify) and creating an account is completely Free!,NEGATIVE
Very good app.i listen to lots of music on hear,POSITIVE
Ok this app is good but please remove limited skips I have the subscription for it and I love it but the free version is just so bad so make it so you have unlimited skips the ads are fine but the limited skips are just bad so please remove that,NEGATIVE
Make the ads a little shorter and its all good,NEGATIVE
I can't play the music that I want to listen the whole albums starts playing.. please fix that thing up,NEGATIVE
"Dear spotify, your app is great. But my eyes bleed when i see the background color of lyrics on desktop version. Please change it to softer color.",NEGATIVE
"I thought Deezer was bad but Spotify I can't even login, keeps saying you're offline when I'm definitely online. I can't be stressing my brains just to access music, I'm out",NEGATIVE
Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it,NEGATIVE
"What the heck is going on with this app? It was great and now it skips and when I open the app to turn off what I'm listening to, the player at the bottom has disappeared and I can't turn it off without closing the app. Restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily. Reinstalling the app only works temporarily. I have loved Spotify but am considering switching to Amazon Music because of this nonsense.",NEGATIVE
This app is the best way to listen to music,POSITIVE
"Great app I've been using it for years and have paid for my subscription. For the last few days there is no way to stop, skip or fast forward the songs. I have to close the entire window to get music to stop playing. Please fix.",POSITIVE
"Spotify app on PC is great, you can't doubt that. Although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. You can't even have fun with music anymore because Spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.",NEGATIVE
It's a good music app but I don't understand why I just cannot continue to skip freely from one track to another. Why restrict the number of times one can skip tracks while listening to a playlist.,NEGATIVE
Suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again Please do check this,POSITIVE
The quality of music got worse when i got premium the transitions between songs slowed down and wouldn't load as fast,NEGATIVE
"two days ago all songs from playlists i listened to were showed in the history of songs i listened to recently as just songs, i mean there werenâ€™t any playlists and then songs from them, just songs. it confuses searching now, nothing has changed yet. i need answers, i have no idea whatâ€™s happening, and it extremely complicates using this app. upd: why canâ€™t i download music lol? what now? nothing changed either.",NEGATIVE
Great app! One problem! Stop politicizing the ads! I download it to listen to music not hear about LGBTQ or abortion or vaccines.,NEGATIVE
Can't open the app anymore. What the heck is going on?,NEGATIVE
Great tunes and selection,POSITIVE
Been listening to Spotify for years. Never have been asked to rate it. Got a new phone and it wants to know what I think. If I didn't like it I'd be using another platform.,NEGATIVE
"it's a wonderful music app, and i definitely recommend. however, one issue i have is the imbalance between the different platforms. pc, almost everything you want from the app besides ""no ads"". tablet, quality is kinda the same on PC, but different because it's a tablet. phone, god, it needs to improve. ads, sure whatever, i get it. but not being able to choose what song to listen to and only 6 skips an hour? what if someone can't afford a tablet or PC? rethink this, because it's stupidly unfair",NEGATIVE
The recent update has rendered this the most annoying app on my phone. Constantly losing the playing bar. Used to work without issues. Huawei p30 Pro,NEGATIVE
I've been usthis for a while and figured they deserved of this reading I've been using this and I've never had no problems with it it's a little expensive but worth it,POSITIVE
Really love playing spotify,POSITIVE
"Nvm, free spotify sucks",NEGATIVE
"Wow... I moved from ios to Android and the lack of care for Android is astonishing. I'm a software engineer and I would have been fired months ago if I released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. This is not acceptable. It's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. Each new release makes the app more and more unstable. Probably priority is ios and Android just gets the crumbs.",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.,POSITIVE
"I really don't care about the random pauses in the music. What upsets me is that after 14 days, everything is on shuffle. Like, you cannot pick a certain song on a playlist. Basically, it is forcing you to buy premium or else you will always be annoyed.",NEGATIVE
"The best ever music app after Google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. Specially the premium plan is so worth it. ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‡",POSITIVE
Nice listening to wonderful music!,POSITIVE
"Don't use this app, don't give your money to Spotify. Switch to bandcamp and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. Latest update appears to have completely borked the shuffle function, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is very greedy, as in the free plan it puts shuffle on and it can't be turned off at all, and so many other things like that are added so you have to get premium. Not worth it, get Pandora.",NEGATIVE
"Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
"Well, what does this app offer that needs rating? It collects and plays the work of others well. Displays the artwork of others well. Its homepage is straight bad and mostly pushing things I will never and have never clicked on. They should have a ""simple"" mode that gets rid of all the faff and lets you just listen to music. After all, it doesn't pay its artists, so why does it need to advertise? I already pay for it!",NEGATIVE
It's a good app Just I don't like how I have to spend so much a month and only 6 skips pur hour it's should be six skips pur 30 minutes so when a add comes on we will get some skips,POSITIVE
It was nice and I loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day I was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app the reinstalled it back but it still happened please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it,POSITIVE
"Why won't my Playlist restart? I keep starting my Podcast so I can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, Why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip",NEGATIVE
"I pay for my monthly subscription and the same day it quits working. Tried uninstalling,, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. Can't get past initial logo screen. So who's refunding my money????",NEGATIVE
"It has alot of songs of any genre, and if you pay the premium then it just gets better and better, 10/10 recommended",POSITIVE
The February update broke Spotify connect to my car's Bluetooth radio is no longer able to connect to Spotify,NEGATIVE
"I can't play any song that I pick, randomly cuts halfway through a song and 6 skips an hour shouldn't be a feature, I have no trouble with this on a console, like PlayStation but this is just generally unusable.",NEGATIVE
"WHAT HAPPEN TO THE CANVAS? I can't skip to next songs (both on phone and Bluetooth), cannot select loop, random, or direct, can't see the lyrics, and can't skip through songs. PLEASE FIX THIS",NEGATIVE
"I am begging you, improve the offline functionality. Song that are supposed to be downloaded won't play, the menues are buggy as hell offline and half the time will just not load, sometimes I can't even pull up my library.",NEGATIVE
I did love using Spotify! Not anymore since I'm ANNOYED that ALL of my playlists are gone for some reason...,NEGATIVE
I really like it. Easy to use and customize.,POSITIVE
"Great app, always has up to date music and I can generally always find the songs I'm looking for. I hate ad's so it's definitely worth the monthly subscription. I love listening to music while commuting and Spotify helps make the journey less boring.",POSITIVE
"a new updaye and same issue as below. last time I had to contact support to fix it. used to love it. a few weeks ago after an update, I stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu. The app is also switching to playing on the phone after I turned the car off post Bluetooth. Neither of these were ever an issue, I changed nothing about my phone setup.",NEGATIVE
"Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder.",NEGATIVE
I'm an artist and Spotify doesn't even let me listen to my own song. It keeps playing other songs that I don't like :)),NEGATIVE
"Great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button.",POSITIVE
We love our Spotify!,POSITIVE
Excellent perfomence with greatest hearing experience... The sound system ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
I love Spotify so much but I have two reasons why I don't like it. 1) I hate the ads. 2) premium is good but expensive and it made me broke,POSITIVE
The only reason I returned to this God awful app is to watch jre. Although I haven't been able to in over a year because their mobile app is so poorly made I'll end up waiting five minutes for something to load just for it to buffer every twenty seconds without fail. Beyond frustrating to use even without the ads. I couldn't recommend this app any less and I personally believe an honest to God 8-track would be an improvement to whatever the hell Spotify claims to be.,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music,POSITIVE
everything costs. And the random songs being added to your playlist is annoying.,NEGATIVE
"Fix the app! Keeps crushing, plays what ever it wants, doesn't react, if I want to switch it off I need to close it from the background.",NEGATIVE
The sound quality and other features are exceptional.,POSITIVE
how come when we use spotify on computer we can loop for free but when we use it on phone we gotta pay. cmon man thats just stupid,NEGATIVE
Good music i can find heheh even old music hehe,POSITIVE
Whenever I open the app and numerous times while using it I get a message that I should turn on Bluetooth. I know Bluetooth is off. I turned it off. There are no Bluetooth devices where I am. It has become so annoying that I am looking for an alternative,NEGATIVE
Spotify is great for listening to albums. And it's cool to be able to make playlists.,POSITIVE
"Spotify gives you access to a lot of music, but often fails at functionally working. It doesn't have all the albums I want but has an interesting way of recommending new music.",POSITIVE
"If I were to compare, Spotify is the best music app for me. I love the interface sm! Although there are some bugs and stuffs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience in this app. I hope you'd add more songs and improve the sound quality just like AM (it's already good but I don't think it would hurt if you make it better hehe)",POSITIVE
My app won't even open... I have tried reinstalling it and it still won't work..,NEGATIVE
Good but can be a bit confusing and difficult. Sometimes u search and play ur particular song and pops up a total different one . Spotify should really work on that,POSITIVE
The app will not open to the log in page,NEGATIVE
"FIX SPOTIFY, I have explicit content on, yet it won't let me play the songs, FIX THIS PLEASE.",NEGATIVE
You can't always view video or track at what point in the audio the song is. Why? This is a problem that Amazon and YouTube do not encounter.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify was great until all of a sudden I logged out for 1 quick second and now I can't load into the app and I'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Been having this problem recently where I am only stuck on a Spotify logo basically the loading screen where I have to wait before it loads. I've been waiting a lot just to see the damn loading screen for hours. I tried uninstalling and redownloading it but nothing works I tried a lot of ways such as restarting my phone, clearing data and cache, refreshing the app but nothing happens just that damn logo and a black screen surrounding it. I can't believe this. Fix this damn app.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify was best in the beggining, you can play any song you like and I believe to be add free, However like 1 month after download when I click a song It doesn't even even play the song I chose. I don't know if this happens with other people on Mobile however it is very annoying click a song only to hear something else.",NEGATIVE
"Free spotify tends to get more insidious the more you use it to frustrate you into paying for premium, to the point that it would play 2 songs then 3 ads repeatedly",NEGATIVE
"After using over five(5) music ðŸŽµ apps , this is one of many I give a five(5)+ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ”¥ In which I enjoy sharing With family and friends. Also , you can creat your Own playlist ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ§ And share .... ðŸ”#1ðŸŽ­âœ¨âœ¨ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"The last time I tuned in, it kept flicking from one song to another, and wouldn't let me listen to the song that I wanted to.",POSITIVE
"It just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. Then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. Got full bars, 5G unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. Pandora and utube music play just fine. Starting to wonder why I pay for this when it",NEGATIVE
"It's nice, but there are too many things to pay for",NEGATIVE
"My spotify has been working fine for 5 years. i cleared the app data to clear some space on my phone. Now when I click onto the app, it doesnt go pass the green logo which im stuck on. Cant get to the login screen or anything. PLEASE FIX THIS spotify is my lifeeeeeee",NEGATIVE
I mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like JRE and appreciate Spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time. Frequently when I go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesn't come up so if it has video I can't see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesn't register its playing. If the app was more reliable I would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isn't worth it.,NEGATIVE
sptify is a nice app . but it dosent let us enjoy the music. Ads every second and only 5skips a day! its forcing the user to pay. and thats lame .pls let some freedom for the useres so they dont hate this app.,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and provides great suggestions!,POSITIVE
Found the app easy to use and your options are limitless,NEGATIVE
Last update won't let the app open!!!!,NEGATIVE
"My music the way I want it, where I want it... when I want it. Love the Spotify App!",POSITIVE
Thumbnail is other artists and songs item list of another artist,NEGATIVE
The stupidest app really. You take premium for a week and you can download only 30 songs?! Disgusting. Never spending one more penny on this useless app.,NEGATIVE
"I love spotify and use is all the time,but the only thing that I don't like about spotify is that it doesn't play all of the songs on the playlist before it repeats some of the songs. But other than that I would definitely recommend it.",POSITIVE
"I love spotify. It not only has music I like it also has podcasts that fit my interests. And I don't mean sport or anime podcast even though I haven't looked. I'm talking crime, supernatural, or scary type podcasts.",POSITIVE
Spotify is an awesome music app.,POSITIVE
Trash app wouldn't even use if Joe Rogan hadn't moved over. Literally randomly just changed podcasts and pauses for no reason all the time.,NEGATIVE
"I've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I wanna play a song on my playlist.",NEGATIVE
No issue and encountered eversince I installed this app super users friendly and was to link to my car and bt speaker.,NEGATIVE
I love spotify so much.,POSITIVE
"Constantly stopping, regularly not showing playback options and offline mode is spotty at best.",NEGATIVE
Why the hell cant i play my playlist do i need to shuffle it? Stop trying to give me songs that are like the songs in my playlist. Just let me listen to my damn songs its annoying,NEGATIVE
"The app has horrendous lag on my Note 10+ yet works fine on my brother's phone, I am fully updated to the newest version I can, and the issue persists. There is something deeply wrong with this app, and it needs to be figured out soon.",NEGATIVE
"Many problems with this app. #1 You canâ€™t even play the songs you want. Every time I shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that arenâ€™t even there. #2 Too much ads. #3 Whenever I search for a song, I have to go through every single playlist that appeared till I find the one I want, sometimes I donâ€™t even find it. #4 You have 6 skips every hour but canâ€™t even play what you want so I just skip to the song I want but then my skips are just wasted. You need to fix this.",NEGATIVE
"Really knows how to setup the music, great system ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"The app has such a variety of music and gives new artist so you dont get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality the add situation is a little abnocious having to pay a fair price with no adds and offline music is a fair deal still the adds should depend on how many months/years your account was created so the longer you have uour account the less adds.",NEGATIVE
This app is so annoying....after the last update all playlist has under go on shuffle mood and you cant disable it without buy a premium...... and you cant change song over 6 time..... this is so disappointing..... I am going to uninstall this app,NEGATIVE
Sometimes it's laggy for me. Crashes often too...(ã€€ï¼›âˆ€ï¼›)...,NEGATIVE
"Since mid May 2022, I can't play anything on Spotify. All of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. Even official Spotify playlists are empty. Edited: There's been 4 updates since this post and I still can't listen to any music. I pay for this and I can't use it. The website works but I can't download a playlist there so I have to use my mobile data. I'll be switching to Pandora, I guess. I prefer Spotify but I can't use it! ðŸ˜¡",NEGATIVE
Keeps asking to allow Bluetooth. I have said yes and later and it won't stop every time I open the app. So annoying,NEGATIVE

I love spotify to be honest wichall,POSITIVE
Spotify is okay but I can't loop it or choose my song. YouTube let's me do that. I can do that on my computer Spotify but not mobile. It sucks.,NEGATIVE
Too many ads like gawd I know I have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously Even once is enough,NEGATIVE
Since I updated the app won't open.,NEGATIVE
I love the app and the premium prices are reasonable. The only problem I have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy this app. The weekly discovery is awesome!,POSITIVE
The songs are amazing,POSITIVE
"Keeps saying no internet, when set to offline, when stuff I'm trying to play is downloaded stuff? Turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing? Worked great for years now this? Why do i pay for premium?",NEGATIVE
The progress bar issue was fixed and it is the great app it used to be once again,POSITIVE
"It's all about the money first of all when I want to listen to a certain playlist via artist or made by myself ,IT ALWAYS PLAY ""SUGGESTED"" SONGS. It so irritating because let alone I can't chose the song I can't get more than 6 skips an hour when it's playing song that shouldn't even be there . I liked it better when the subscription was unlimited skips and no ads ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ",NEGATIVE
"Big fan, keeps doing really weird things like not showing that it's playing, unable to fast forward or rewind because I can't get to the song playing, gives me random adds and won't let me skip by then even though I have the payed version.",POSITIVE
Great so far haven't had to deal with advertising yet,POSITIVE
"Just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and I don't know why, I can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song I don't know comes on that I didn't put on my playlist) I can't even chose the song I want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys",NEGATIVE
There was like 1 billion ads and I didn't even get the songs I wanted,NEGATIVE
Its a great app for music and in my opinion the best,POSITIVE
Not having 30 minutes of commercial listening.,NEGATIVE
Forget this. Im going back to Youtube. At least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. Alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. Total ripoff,NEGATIVE
I try to play the song on my Play list and Play songs I didn't add,NEGATIVE
Love this app but kinda silly how you have to pay to listen i mean seriously! I rather listen to my music on YouTube.,NEGATIVE
I LOVE the more like this tab for podcasts! I love it so much I closed out the app and rated it after years of having Spotify ðŸ˜‚ definitely need more changes like this!!!!! Comment section next?? ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€,POSITIVE
I started payin for Spotify but is stops playing. I don't know why. Actually i am paying exactly for its playin in background. But it doesn't. Play button disappeared anyway. I can not shut it down. Unbelievable!,NEGATIVE
Plays songs that I didnt even add to my playlist,NEGATIVE
"Works okay at the moment, but there's a slight issue where the genre slider at the top of the liked songs list cannot slide. :)",NEGATIVE
Great app and music ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸ðŸŽ´DONT DOWNLOAD Bad app for misic it contains frequently ad 2:1RATIO OF ADS,NEGATIVE
Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,NEGATIVE
Great music definitely a great app to have.,POSITIVE
Very good app for music and podcast. But ads are too frequent.,NEGATIVE
I love the selection of music. Oldies that I knew my granny loved that I couldn't find elsewhere.,POSITIVE
Any other Android users having issues with the app? I've read alot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! Extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. All Bots when trying to resolve the issue! Back to Pandora I go!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ˜.,POSITIVE
"Was terrible, couldn't stand using the app with ads and limited skips... then I got premium. Now, all I ever use is Spotify. No ads, no taking up phone space, and pretty much all the music I listen to. Sometimes I have an itch for a song that isn't available on Spotify, so I just YouTube it and carry on with my day. The only subscription I won't be getting rid of any time soon :D",NEGATIVE
"Offline mode takes a while to respond, an issue that has plagued 3 of my phones (2x Samsung, 1x oppo many android update, app updates and years later still.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is great!,POSITIVE
"Everything is almost alright. Whenever I play my liked songs shuffled, after couple of my liked songs are played a little after you play song THAT I NEVER LIKED WHY PLAY THEM WHEN I HAVEN'T LIKED THEM. FIX THIS. Not only that every 10 minutes i get an add. Don't hmu with the bs of not bothering you with adds for 30 minutes. THANKS FOR DISABLING MY ACCOUNT AFTER I WROTE THIS, everything was fine before I rated this.",POSITIVE
Performance is very poor When i search for music and I tap the play button it play different much,NEGATIVE
Changing my review from 1 star for the free version. I just got a student subscription and the app works super fast. I am able to listen to songs in different languages (a lot of them with lyrics). The playlists are also useful as I can discover new songs. Spotify has got to be the best music player in the world right now. :),POSITIVE
Spotify was good untill they started the 8 ads in a row deal,POSITIVE
Constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. Plus the podcast video player could really use an update.,NEGATIVE
"Very happy, thanks A very good range of fantastic music Kind regards from Ollie from freezing Frankston 3199 Victoria lol",POSITIVE
"I tried logging in but I keep receiving an error message of ""offline kindly connect to the internet"" which Is very annoying because I'm very sure I'm connected to the internet.Not until I uninstall and reinstall and now I have to redownload my songs.",NEGATIVE
"I've been using and paying for Spotify premium since I was in 7th grade. I am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",NEGATIVE
New update is horrible. Not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. I recommend SoundCloud or YouTube Music.,NEGATIVE
"great music app, only problem is that the shuffle feature isnt actually random and it picks the same handful of songs each time.",NEGATIVE
Best app in the world for music lovers1â™¥ï¸,POSITIVE
Great music selection..,POSITIVE
Voice is very clear and good,POSITIVE
"App constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. For example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. Sucks.",NEGATIVE
"I will never pay for Spotify. It's a scam. Literally every other song is an ad an then when I am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. How do you let a 4 minute song go over 6 mins and had I not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. It's absolutely ridiculous",NEGATIVE
It plays every song I could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,POSITIVE
This is everything I needed thank you spotify,POSITIVE
Absolutely Stunning! More like they know my soul and give me what i want. ðŸ–¤,POSITIVE
"What is up with free Spotify. I get that I'm not going to get the best version of the app but you only have 6 skips. The 6 skips are that bad but pair it with when you play a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even on your playlist. So you skip those song but then the app is like: ""woah slow down instead of skipping try editing your playlist?"" And you can't edit your playlist because it's playimg random songs. And when you search noooo it has to play more random songs.",NEGATIVE
Use any other app. Constantly stops playing for no reason. Sometimes stopping after 5 minutes or less.,NEGATIVE
"The best app ever they is no song I cannot fine hear toms up ,ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"Loved it, but then the app started getting really buggy and now it thinks there's no Internet access when I can easily connect with other apps. Going to cancel subscription.",NEGATIVE
Its a great app but.. Since the new update spotify is just noðŸ’€ you cant even play your fav song over and over why did you removed that in the app idk whos idea to put random songs in your playlist who EVER thought of that is a horrible idea,NEGATIVE
Had to uninstall and reinstall for the second time due to years-old bug triggered by app updates when spotify set to offline mode. Cannot login unless I do this.,NEGATIVE
Really great app I got what am paying for couldn't be happier ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Why pay for premium if there's still going to be ads every 7 minutes? Is there something more I have to do to turn the ads off??,NEGATIVE
Super sound quality,POSITIVE
"It's great n all but it has an issue when I'm using it,it only has the logo and it won't open I hope you guys fix this.ðŸ˜",NEGATIVE
"The app has been getting more and more buggy and even with a subscription, I get pop-ups advertising in-app podcasts I have no desire to listen to.",NEGATIVE
"Every couple of months the app's 'fun' side rears it's ugly head. I'm talking the sound cutting out for no reason till you open the app again, downloaded files that are in the downloads folder not playing till you're back on wifi or turn your data back on and the app not showing on your device that anything is playing when it clearly is. As we speak, Spotify started playing again randomly after cutting out for 10 minutes. Thanks Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Literally can't live without Spotify. By far the superior music experience in my opinion ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸ðŸ˜…,POSITIVE
I love the fact that I can listen to whatever kind of music I like!,POSITIVE
100% satisfied with this app. We can search and hear any songs and make playlist. Love this appðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,POSITIVE
"Even after paying for premium, it's not getting reflected.",NEGATIVE
This app has changed my music experience. Thanks guys!,POSITIVE
Constantly has player issues where it'll randomly stop playing and you need to reinstall to fix it. Just use the browser version instead.,NEGATIVE
It really good but entire it was ðŸ‘Ž good because it didn't have the song on everyone time,POSITIVE
"I've been having issues connecting with remote play, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my favorite/hearted songs. Edit: This has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time I can't play music unless I click the shuffle button, it doesn't let me select individual songs. Not sure what I'm paying for at this rate. Tested on two Pixels and a Moto.. Edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??",NEGATIVE
"Don't like the advertisements so much. Lately they've been getting lengthy with sometimes 5 in a row, which throws a wrench in my workout.",POSITIVE
Every songs are here best app like instagram and also BTS songs are here each and every,POSITIVE
Could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify.. My music go to..,POSITIVE
Very easy to use. Updated gebra of music.,POSITIVE
This is very good app to listen song and sing with that by reading lyrics.,POSITIVE
It is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because I used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that I have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore,NEGATIVE
Super super it's all no words Better than these app *gana app *Hangama * Jio savan Great work from Spotify .,NEGATIVE
"Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium.",NEGATIVE
This app is a nice app for music and podcast and there are my favourite artist,POSITIVE
i cant open the app : ( tried installing-uninstalling the app multiple times already... still not responding,NEGATIVE
New update... Why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!,NEGATIVE
Best app for podcasts ....best suggestion.but the ads are annoying so Spotify make sure you reduce the amount of ads,NEGATIVE
"Love it!!! Nothing else to say that would be better than ""love it!!!""",POSITIVE
"After this last update the app won't even open ok my phone, it's just stuck on the loading screen",NEGATIVE
"I loved spotify, but the most recent update makes it where I can't pick what song is playing, and it just plays randomly and never plays music on my playlist anymore, if this is the new Spotify, I will be deleting Spotify and use something else, now I also can't see what is even on my playlist anymore, it just has a list and not a playlist",NEGATIVE
Tired of your ads ðŸ˜‘ uninstalling itðŸ˜‘,NEGATIVE
Fantastic for music lovers.. On point!,POSITIVE
"Y'all should add some features that will make the app incredible. One, add a feature that can allow users to play all offline songs. Two, add a supermix. And three, add two tabs on the home page that will say ""music"" and ""podcast"" it's time to separate music from podcast. Also, make it easy to download podcast episodes. I want to enjoy a podcast show without any pausing(buffering). Maybe auto download.",POSITIVE
Annoying. Stop shuffling my music!,NEGATIVE
Great selection of classic period music from the sixties ...,POSITIVE
Awesome because now I can hear my favorite songs,POSITIVE
Doesn't let me skip recommended songs even when I had skips left,POSITIVE

Failure to launch. Even after multiple unistall and reistall doesn't get passed icon screen. 0/5 stars not Samsung friendly.,NEGATIVE
"App always going off lately! Very annoying. I thought I was the only one, but reading reviews here, many facing same issue.",NEGATIVE
Keeps crashing when I open it.,POSITIVE
It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,NEGATIVE
So I was using Spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. Whenever I get a message notification from WhatsApp then notification beep sound continues. No matter what I try the beep sound continues. I don't know whether it's happening because my phone have some bugs or Spotify having some issues. Need an explanation if it's possible.,NEGATIVE
ðŸ‘ amazing! I often have to restart app to fix glitch but worth it!,POSITIVE
"No mather what i do, it will keep playing. I close and it playes again.. damn stupid app...",NEGATIVE
Goood all search enjoy songs,POSITIVE
"ðŸª¶.... Spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app Ever, I couldn't live without it now... Soooo much better than YouTube the fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest & the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowing..Thank you Spotify xoxo",POSITIVE
Great app and amazing wide variety of content. Ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. Price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!,POSITIVE
I think this app is great though the only thing i wish that it has was the loop the song forever although i think it is a premium function and it is alright i think it is a 4.5 around there. Definitely better than youtube music in all other parts though especially the ads experiece wow you can listen to a whole hour of spotify and hardly any advertisements would pop out,POSITIVE
Why the app always force stop... After few it will stop.,NEGATIVE

Sound quality is very good ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
I've been getting bugs. Pause button won't appear. The bottom thingy won't appear when I'm playing a song. I keep restarting the app but it doesn't fix it.,NEGATIVE
What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.,NEGATIVE
When I was enter this app it's took more time to loading,NEGATIVE
Why there is no previous feature in my application this also a updated version then why I don't have fix this issue fast................... As soon as possible ............ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,NEGATIVE
App won't open. Just crashes,NEGATIVE
Keeps playing stuff other than the play list I created,NEGATIVE

Super music app high quality misic,NEGATIVE
"I really do enjoy using this app but recently there has been an issue that has been bugging me. Anytime I try to play music offline, some songs in the playlist do not play (I use premium). I would have to go online in order for them to play. I haven't had this problem before so I presume it's an issue from the app, it's quite annoying and I'd like if it's fixed",NEGATIVE
Need a very very very high connection,NEGATIVE
"I used to use YT vanced, it was a good app for BG music then i downloaded this, no doubt this is a good music streaming app but ads after every song?? One ad says that 30 mins interrupted songs and after that song again there is a ad, disappointed",NEGATIVE

It's a really good app with amazing pod casts and songs i loved but the thing is that i gave 4 stars is after some time ads are coming too much hope you'll work on it and i recommend you all to use this app,POSITIVE
"7.5.22 App has been glitchy the last few days. Podcasts stop every 10 minutes. No control buttons, can't pause or back up. Normally this is fixed in short order but it's been too long. I mostly like this app. One ask I have is to make autoplay settings separate for podcasts. Depending on where I am when I select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. I want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you! Also shuffle available from the top of all playlists?",NEGATIVE
I like this app cause i can hear every song,POSITIVE
The daily mix is the same music every day nothing new. Don't now wy they mix it every day with the same music.,NEGATIVE
It's an absolute cheating against those people who don't buy Spotify Premium... Because there are 3 long nasty ads after each and every song... I'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...,NEGATIVE
It's audio is really clear as well as there is smooth transition between 2 songs and it recommends music with careful consideration. Great for listening offline,POSITIVE
One of the best music applications I've used.,POSITIVE
Spotify's good reputation is well deserved. Their recommendation system is first rate; the user experience is very strong and is regularly improved with updates.,POSITIVE
Nights with lovely songs is awesome,POSITIVE
It's great to be able to listen to a album of my choice,POSITIVE
Will pause songs randomly of you don't give the app permission to run 24/7 in thr background without restrictions on android. I do t want it starting or running in the background when I am not using it. It acts like I lost signal when using it if I have it as a sleeping app when not in using it. I canceled my premium membership because of this issue. Why pay for music that skips because you don't want it running all the time when not in use.,NEGATIVE
Completely unusable app. Literally crashes when you attempt to launch it. Don't know why I pay for their service.,NEGATIVE
"PODCASTS DO NOT PLAY. I PAY FOR PREMIUM, MUSIC WORKS BUT NOT PODCASTS.",NEGATIVE
"Loved spotify and have used premuim, meaning I pay, for years now. HOWEVER, for at least two months now the app has been crashing, randomly pausing my music, and not displaying any banner or display for the active audio. I've been very patient and stuck with an app I have appreciated, but that might change if spotify does not fix these issues soon.",NEGATIVE
"I loved this app so much! I used it every day for hours and got premium. But recently my account won't let me play anything, and it changed the entire set up of my library, removing all my playlists. I tried to make another account and it's the same thing! I would be so happy if you could fix it! Because I love this app, I just can't play anything! (Problem solved! Thanks Spotify!)",POSITIVE

Great music app. Only issue with it is that it sometimes stops. I have close it down and reopen it but this doesn't happen very often.,NEGATIVE
"No controls visible anymore. (Play, pause, etc) My app will stop playing for no reason. This just started over the last few days. Without the play / pause option, I cannot pause my podcast or music when someone comes to speak with me. Additionally, the app keeps playing despite receiving phone calls.",NEGATIVE
"Too many ads,not playing the correct song that i choose.",NEGATIVE
Love it. Getting all my favorites.,POSITIVE
"Randomly skips my songs, won't let me pick specific songs in my playlist, literally missing basic functions you can find in 99% of other music players if you don't buy premium, they want to make it as mind numbing and painful to use their app as possible so you can give them money for something that others can give you for free! Atleast with youtube I can pick songs from my playlist to play without skipping through my playlist with shuffle.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify rocks it, got kicked off YouTube for expressing my first amendment rights of free speech and don't miss communist Marxist YouTube at all, thanks Spotify!!!!",POSITIVE
I update new update of spotify then I open the app then my library is deleting my library song fix this issue,NEGATIVE

Way too many ads,NEGATIVE
I can't live without spotify ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
"What has happened to this app? Where has the now playing screen gone? No way to control what's happening on the app anymore. I can't rewind, I can't skip the inbeded grifter ads by the podcasters or rewind and listen to something interesting.",NEGATIVE
Full package when it comes to music,POSITIVE
"Love it been using it for a while, the liked song play list is awesome though I massively wish there'd be a 'relaxing' genre tab for sorting if it does that in the future I'll easily give it 10 stars",POSITIVE
Poor user interface. You have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. Why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??,NEGATIVE
"App is great! They should tell you though that after an update you should restart your phone, you know, just like your computer so your update can take effect!",POSITIVE
I shuffle thousands of songs and it's always the same 10 scattered at the beginning.,NEGATIVE
This is the best app for song's,POSITIVE
"Very buggy lately (July 2022). The app constantly bugs out, loosing the now playing bar and becoming unresponsive. The only way to stop play back is to force stop the app.",NEGATIVE
"Pretty good other than the queue option. When you want to go to the previous queued track, the queue gets lost for some reason and it plays a different song?!",POSITIVE
"Spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. I will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when I try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what I'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. I've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.",NEGATIVE
Way too many ads at this point I listen to more ads than music,NEGATIVE
Nice app for music i can enjoy listening cuz most of the songs are available. But it will be great if lyrics were romanized cuz its difficult to sing along as an international kpop stan,NEGATIVE
Nice app all music,POSITIVE
"The app keeps crashing, songs disappear, had to make new accounts cause it wouldn't let me sign in even if I changed the password and now it just won't open. I'm done, peace out!",NEGATIVE
Great music collection,POSITIVE
"Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.",NEGATIVE
"Really good, only problem is the advising it does if u don't have Spotify premium, other than that a 5/5",NEGATIVE
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.",NEGATIVE
"App is not working, it won't load... It only shows the Spotify symbol and it won't do nothing",NEGATIVE
Excellent selection of music and user friendly,POSITIVE
"I really like Spotify,Much better than other music apps.",POSITIVE

App stopped working on Pixel 6 with latest update. Force closes instantly.,NEGATIVE
"It's been a month of waiting, I'm still looking at my screen a logo of Spotify how nice isn't.",NEGATIVE
What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,NEGATIVE
We can pick make our fave playlist,POSITIVE
My play/pause options have disappeared. This is very annoying! Plus the app starts playing on my phone when I turn the car off. Which I can't stop because I don't have the control bar. Loved the app before this happened.,NEGATIVE
"Fix the shuffle ""always on issue"" I'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. Frustrating doesn't even describe it.",NEGATIVE
I can't open the app it only displays the logo. I tried clearing the data and cache but still doesn't work.,NEGATIVE
"It's extremely annoying that I need an internet connection to view my ""downloaded"" content. That tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. In addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my ""episodes."" Later, even though I haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as ""downloaded"" again. Shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?",NEGATIVE
"It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",NEGATIVE
Makes me fall in love with music again!,POSITIVE
I really love to hear music on spotify ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,POSITIVE
"After this last update, my app keeps opening and crashing. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail did that work. Such a shame because this would have been a 4 star review. I hope they fix this issue soon",NEGATIVE
Great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use YT and kill bandwidth,POSITIVE
"I used to really love this app, so I ended up going Premium. However, for a few months now there has been countless problems. Music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. I've contacted Spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. I think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.",NEGATIVE
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.,NEGATIVE
I always find the music that I'm looking for.,POSITIVE

"SECURITY ISSUE. The accounta are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. Have been using it for almost a year to discover this. Your login information is NOT secure. Apart from that.. App is not upto the standard. Bells and whistles but no quality. Low quality customer support for a paid service.

So I have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when I go to download my play list it says to many devices ( we only use 4) so I log everyone out and still same problem fix it Now or loose a long time subscriber,NEGATIVE
"Has lyrics, integrates better with Chromecast than the Google music service - seamlessly changing from computer to phone to tv, even automatically when I put my earbuds in. I am amazed how well this works. 11/10, it's the little things that matter and it's clear the people making this care",POSITIVE
"App won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen",NEGATIVE

"Break comes again and again, the mind is bad, that's why I am deleting this app, bad app is bad",NEGATIVE
"it won't let me past the opening screen with the logo I tried re Installing, clear data/cache, force stop , restarting device nothing seems to work plus I don't get canvas feature so I'm gonna cancel premium",NEGATIVE
"Love this app been premium for like 2-3 years, but now i can't go into home (like first page when u enter) and would be cool if that is fixed",NEGATIVE
"Now it stops when you open another app. Music keep randomly stopping this is on a playlist I have downloaded, also app keeps crashing AGAIN. I cancelled my premium because of the problems before. I can't see me keeping it as not much has changed, always problems",NEGATIVE
"Usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. It closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. Sadly its only the spotify desktop app which is giving me problems, i hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app",NEGATIVE
"I dont listen to music alot but spotify is pretty solid, but im still waiting for that one karaoke feature i saw on tiktok i dont know if thats real or not but ive already updated my spotify so yeah",POSITIVE
Latest update is rubbish. The app is not even working atm. First on my car ay. Now not on Android phone at all. Trying to reinstall the app. Get you stuff together I pay for a working app. Not this,NEGATIVE
"Constamtly randomly pauses, or doesn't let you press play at all. Terrible for a paid for service",NEGATIVE
Worst app I ever seen too much problems. My recommendation please do not download this app..,NEGATIVE
First of all I had to make a new account because it wasn't giving the option for mobile login. Then now when I play a song on shuffle or normally after every skip it reaches the first song I played and it's frustrating seriously,NEGATIVE
The best music app that I have used so far,POSITIVE

Sound is. So clear. Easy to use.,POSITIVE
"So far so good, I am loving the app. It makes collecting my Playlists easy",POSITIVE
"Finally Spotify have put in lyrics if available, such a long time.",NEGATIVE
Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.,NEGATIVE
Had all my music saved to my sd card yet when Spotify updated I lost everything and it won't let me go back to sd card as it keeps trying to download to the phone. There is no problem with my sd card so I blame Spotify for stressing me out unable to use app now offline,NEGATIVE
"Very easy to use, thanks ðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
The song which I want to listen is not played.For example I want to play lut gaye from Jubin Nautiyal.Other song is played but not lut gaye.Very sad.,NEGATIVE
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,NEGATIVE
For those who are tired of the ads provide by Spotify. Just simply download Spotify from happy mod it's 100% safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs ðŸ‘Š[thank me later â˜ºï¸],POSITIVE
"New update sucks, I hate the add to queue option when I press on a song. Just play the darn thing",NEGATIVE
"So many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc",NEGATIVE
Great music listening experience. Would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.,NEGATIVE
I hate it because when I play a song I couldn't hear anything and if I download a song it keeps kicking me out of the app,NEGATIVE
It's a really nice app. Has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. The only problem is too many ads. If maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Option of being able to just hide specific recommendation is just gone?!,NEGATIVE
"App stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",NEGATIVE
"Extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc and also DJ mixes. Very good correspondence",POSITIVE
Love spotify cause I'm able to make my music list and share it with my friends,POSITIVE
Too much of adsðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Welcome to the ad app,POSITIVE
Too much Ads,NEGATIVE
If there is power cut and when light comes and you try to play some music it say no network connection,NEGATIVE
It's Good App Cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun,POSITIVE
Well organised app but reason for 2 stars are 1.) Lots of ads after every 2 songs there's an ad 2.) Connected to wifi with avg speed of 10mbps still there's a network error so I have to close app and open again 2-3 times to try my luck,NEGATIVE
For real bro... 6 skips an hour. Were putting limits on skips now how money hungry can you get,NEGATIVE
Very nice to listen to music,POSITIVE
Horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created,NEGATIVE
"Stupid app, borderline greedy. Forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. Why the auto shuffle? No one needed that thing",NEGATIVE
"I listen to it when i going to sleep, when im exersizin, and even when im playing games with myself.",POSITIVE
"can't really complain , except that sometimes it just stops playing music... this is honestly very irritating , i'm assuming it does this , because i don't a subscription but all in all , i highly recommend it , good quality music edit : I canceled my subscription 2 months ago because I couldn't deal with the double deductions every month. They still deduct money from my account and they are refusing to refund me my money. If you know what's good for you, you will download Apple Music.",POSITIVE
It's a good app but the ads are just annoying and I don't know why we get 6 skips per hour like why not just remove the feature and sometimes I'll be in a sad mood and then an ad will come on and will ruin the vibe And and then another add will come on but look it's a very good app but just lower the ads and remove the 6 skips per hour thing please?!?!,NEGATIVE
"Since the new update, the ""now playing"" tab keeps disappearing and I can't even pause or click next track. After a while, the track stops. I have tried uninstall and install it again, but it keeps happening. Pls fix the bug, it's annoying.",NEGATIVE
"The experience could be improved for offline mode. If I start playing a playlist that I downloaded already online, I'm unable to just continue playing it if I go offline. I must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if I was playing in shuffle mode. Please improve on that. Also, if a Spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. Please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.",NEGATIVE
It helps me calm down and helps me play games longer,POSITIVE
Great sound tracks.,POSITIVE
It is has amazing options. But it always have problems with loading. It always shows (no internet connection available). While all other apps work absolutely fine in my current network connection.,NEGATIVE

Can listen to all my play lists and more,POSITIVE
"Listen,Spotify is a great app, I've been using it for over 3 years,the people on here say 'it plays random songs not from my playlist' usually that is with a normal subscribtion. I highly recommend getting premium,if I'm not mistaken a family package is around R99pm.It is amazing and I really enjoy Spotify and their music!",POSITIVE
Lately the app doeasn't show itself and I can't control it like pause or play or close it. Sometimes I restart the phone itself!,NEGATIVE
Everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.,NEGATIVE
A dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... Just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor I am.... ðŸ˜…,NEGATIVE
I don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an AMAZING app it's just I want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song I want to listen to,POSITIVE
Just keep stopping for no reason. Have to force close to get it working again. ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,NEGATIVE
"Too many adds and more emphasis on buying premium , podcast Don't have adds soo good",NEGATIVE
This app best from all music apps excellent app forever,POSITIVE
"Back then, this app was good and smooth. I've noticed some upsetting developments in the last several days. When I start opening my Spotify app, all I have seen is the logo. It's crashing and freezing at the same time. I've still thought of trying those Tutorials on youtube, but many of them didn't work. So I'm expecting that this concern of mine will be fixed immediately.",NEGATIVE
Amazing I took of my phone expecting to come off like other apps but it did not I'm impressed if u love playing games while listening to music like me I really say download this app truely amazing,POSITIVE

8/10 I don't mind ads but certain ads are annoying,NEGATIVE
The waste app I have seen .30 min per 1 add they will say but 2 songs per one add . The waste and lie app I have seen .,NEGATIVE
"Overall, the app is really good. Knocking a star for the regular harassment to upgrade to a family account from the dual. Enough already!",POSITIVE
Love it #1 in my book. Been a customer for over 4 years,POSITIVE
If only all the songs I downloaded could appear on a single page,NEGATIVE
So much add . and i don't have any interst of premium . please stop,NEGATIVE
"Best app for music and new discoveries. The a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",POSITIVE
It offers good quality and you can also find incredible play lists in this.,POSITIVE
"Used to be my favorite music apps but after log out, i can't open the apps in my phone",NEGATIVE

"I loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. Whenever I try to open to app, It stays on the icon screen forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.",NEGATIVE
I am happy by listening songs with spotify,POSITIVE
"The apps keeps crashing anytime I try to make a Playlist, and even then I can't listen to a single song or podcast because ""my internet connection is not responding"" or something, it says as I play YouTube videos just fine. Even created Playlist appear to be empty. Every. Single. One. If I try to make a Playlist and it doesn't crash for some damn miracle as much as I add songs the Playlist it stays empty... and I really wanted to use this app, fix it or lose my money.",NEGATIVE
"AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album. I hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? Bubby Shot the Jukebox. Ok, I must have done something wrong so I do it again. I never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song.",NEGATIVE
"Can't even start the app, I have to use spotify lite",NEGATIVE
It worked and now it doesn't at all I pay spotify premium just for it not to work,NEGATIVE
There are the songs which you can't even find in YouTube...One of the best music listening app ever,POSITIVE
"Toooooo many ads....its irritating.an ad between 2 songs...worst uh.. Other than ads u can find all the songs, playlists... I'm gonna uninstall it due to ads ðŸ˜’",NEGATIVE
"I love this app so much to be honest, tho paying 10$ for premium is a bit much and when i turn off my phone to listen to it same will the music sometimes but all and all i love this app so much its really great! :)",POSITIVE
spotify is the best app to listen to music!! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© but sometimes i'm always indecisive on the song i should listen to ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹,POSITIVE
"For me, at one point it would just not load. For example, the Spotify symbol would just stay on the screen frozen, not doing anything until I just gave up on it.",NEGATIVE
Alot of ads,NEGATIVE
This app used to be great but in like the past year it's gotten to where it doesn't load. Even songs that are downloaded won't load if you don't have internet connection. I don't understand why I'm paying such a high fee n can't have my music and podcast,NEGATIVE
"Been running into a bunch of bugs recently. The most annoying is that I can't add more than one thing to the queue. If I keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and I have to restart my phone several times to get it to work. Every now and then the control bar will disappear so I can't pause whatever I'm listening to even if I try from my headphones. Not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately. I've reported it before, never heard back",NEGATIVE
I like the feature that has lyrics but it'd be nice to have the option available to cast the lyrics to the same device I'm listening on.,NEGATIVE
I love the songs it has diffrent langigesit. Its... Perslfect,NEGATIVE
The User Experience and UI of the mobile app is awful. Lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.,NEGATIVE
"not sure what happened but for 2 days now, my mobile spotify app hasn't been working. it's showing my playlists on the home page, but not in my library. whenever i click on a playlist, it shows zero songs, so i can't play music on my phone at all. fix this please!!!!",NEGATIVE
App gets stuck on the logo screen,NEGATIVE
You can find all your music favorites....And still doing it Thanks,POSITIVE
"I really enjoy this app and kindly i be searching songs, that i have never listened for a long long timeâ¤ thanks to this app niether it depletes to much data cost, but thanksðŸ˜ðŸ¤™ðŸ»",POSITIVE
Easy Interface....Personalised playlists...superb sound quality.,POSITIVE
I think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. And it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app I recommend.,POSITIVE
The app it's self isn't that bad great selection of music but the algorithm for Shuffle is horrible.,NEGATIVE
"It's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're SOL, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. This also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. You wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",NEGATIVE
Years in and I still love it. Never a problem. So much easier than ANY other app. Love my music and they deliver. Thank you..,POSITIVE
They just removed a latest marathi film songs album which I was frequently listening these days. The claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.,NEGATIVE
5 stars Spotify Your the Goat for fixing it lots of love. Never gonna stop using Spotify my goto music sorce!!! 100/100,POSITIVE
Good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again. Some song are unable to play. Last point when entering playlist it took time but when we turn off our net and enter the playlist it's fast... Wts does it mean?? Plzz fixed it,NEGATIVE
"Rarely have I looked for anything - rare, live, obscure...- that I can't find.",NEGATIVE
Very greatful app for song.. And also i request to you please add one feature also to identify any songs.. Especially it is very helpful to identity edited ringtone amd songs... Because i think some people's are knowing nice music and songs through the 1 minute or 30 second edited status video from the whatsapp.. Instagram etc... I hope you try to add a feature to identity musics&songs .. Really iam still enjoying your apps,POSITIVE
I cant open this years wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. Please fix this,NEGATIVE
"It's a good app for music, but there's a lot of ads and you can't skip more than six songs.",POSITIVE
There appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. It's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. Every issue I'm experiencing I can find in other users ratings.,NEGATIVE
"I really love it bcz i love songs to and listening a story horror story, funny story, sad story, romantic story, that u can listen in Spotify you can listen any songs and story and u will enjoy it i promise",POSITIVE
"Since my spotify got premium, my spotify was like possessed by a demon, it changed the song by itself, turns up the volume by itself, and annoys me by opening other pop up screens when I am typing, just like a cellphone screen that gets hit by water. It is not worth it at all.",NEGATIVE
This is a excellent music app to listen to.,POSITIVE
Ever time I played a song it would ether play a song that won't stop playing unless I restart my phone or it would pause at random times!,POSITIVE
"The moment I paid for premium, the app ain't starting and getting hanged. Wasn't expecting this action from Spotify.",NEGATIVE
"The app doesn't load in my phone, but liter version of it does and any other music player",NEGATIVE
In the beginning Spotify was good but now it is the worst I can't skip music when I search for a song it gives me a playlist wih the same name and it doesn't even contain the song I want and songs are not full when I play a song it gives a very very short part of it uh And honestly sound cloud â˜ï¸ is better ðŸ˜Œ,NEGATIVE
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!,NEGATIVE
"I stopped subscribing because you had podcaster that ia an anti vaxxer spreading disinformation. If he is gone , I will come back.",NEGATIVE
It's a pretty good app but i hate the update.,NEGATIVE
Definitely the best. Recommended for many more music lovers.,POSITIVE
"Love this app. Whatever mood I am in, Spotify can satisfy my music craving. I just wish I knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.",NEGATIVE
"Love this app, I only use this for my music streaming. I pay for premium for my family and both my mom and I have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. For example, sometimes when I let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times I have to restart the app. It pauses other times too. It's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.",NEGATIVE
Loving Spotify since 2015,POSITIVE
"You're always updating. Stop. Get it to where it works and don't touch it. Every time you guys update the are problems... or maybe, I don't know, DO IT RIGHT. App is stopping again for no reason. And no, I don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.",NEGATIVE
The volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time I could just open my youtube app.,NEGATIVE
This app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.,NEGATIVE
"I can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot",NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify so much, only reason it doesn't have five stars is because there are so many ads. But, great quality and I love how I can find any song on here!!! <3",POSITIVE
It works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. I'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!,NEGATIVE
Usually I use use spotify daily but recently there's been a glitch and it just shows the logo when I open it and it doesn't work. I've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.,NEGATIVE
I enjoy a mix of music with limited adds,POSITIVE
"For some reason still no access to lyrics unless I make a new account, which makes zero sense...",NEGATIVE
Great app. Sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so I have to keep listening without skipping songs. Normally good though.,NEGATIVE
"The new update sucks a fat one!! Pauses randomly, the player disappears and I can't pause/stop the music. Edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. Very disappinting considering I have a pretty new high-powered Samsung galaxy.",NEGATIVE
"Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",NEGATIVE
I like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,NEGATIVE
"I mean I used to love spotify but now it literally plays an ad after every song. Not only this but it constantly exits the app and stops playing a song for no reason. It also skips songs on its own. It also plays those ads that supposedly gives you 30mins of ad free music if I watch it and when I do watch it, it starts playing ad after ad and it's annoying. I get you need to pay artists but the amount of ads played is ridiculous. Had to move to Apple music, can't use spotify no more.",NEGATIVE
"Come on, its spotify, its the best music app out there",POSITIVE
Excellent listening experience. You can listen to music with the screen off.,POSITIVE
Like the plaY lists they set up for me based on the music I like.,NEGATIVE
It's too good. All the songs I can ask for are available at one platform. I am loving it.,POSITIVE
Easy to use easy to enjoy with my devices!,POSITIVE
it's good but im begging yall to show what playlists a song are in. like for example after you click 'add to playlist' maybe have a mark next to the playlist name if the song is already in the playlist. it would make organizing so much easier and less time consuming please add it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
It's pretty good one day I'll pay the fee but not today lol,POSITIVE
"Spotify suddenly logged out my acc out of nowhere and they wouldn't let me log in. It always says, ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG, TRY TO USE YOUR EMIAL INSTEAD"" but whenever I try to use my email, it always says ""THERE'S NO USER FOUND IN THIS EMAIL"" It's frustrating!!!! I just want my acc back???!?!?!???",NEGATIVE
It's a good app but when I tried to play my own playlist I made it just starts playing random songs that I don't even like Spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs,NEGATIVE
Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.,POSITIVE
Love it lots of great music choices,POSITIVE
I'm not able to open Spotify,NEGATIVE
Definitely a great music an podcast app. Easy to navigate thru the app.,POSITIVE
I absolutely love Spotify!!!,POSITIVE
I hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.Also why can't you remove songs?,POSITIVE
"Love this app. Wish I could work for Spotify, bet it's a real blast. ðŸ˜œ The only issue I have is the ads. Can't afford to go premium just yet !",NEGATIVE
I love that I can see all my favorites and much more,POSITIVE
Bro when I connect my Alex to my phone click on a song it just doesn't play that song even when I am not connected to my Alex very bad aap,NEGATIVE
Used to be Great but now is not. When apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. No customer support exists-- just advice from other users. So to get the value of my Premium Subscription I must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library ðŸ˜žðŸ˜“ðŸ˜© 07/22 no change. Review remains valid,NEGATIVE
Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic,POSITIVE
Great music love this app,POSITIVE
"5 stars, for the most of the times. Car mode could improve. Some songs are not there, but all in all... It rocks ðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
Need to add option to redeem spotify card from app itself .currently I only see a credit card and paypal options .guess you guys dont seems to care .please add that option to the app or me personally I'm done .it shouldn't be hard to add that option to the app.,NEGATIVE
Constantly crashes on my pixel 6. Has so many bugs where it plays music but I can't pause or stop it.,POSITIVE
"I love this app, it gives the listener a high quality of sound and it has great catalogue of music which caters for everyone's tastes. The plus with Spotify Pro you get the added bonus of no ads and get to download whatever song or album you like. Spotify also grows with you, it keeps track of all your music likes and Spotify gives you a more tailor-made experience. 10/10 ' love it.'",POSITIVE
"Great music app, however some great songs are unavailable. I know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever I want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.",NEGATIVE
Now ads bad app,NEGATIVE
Great can use a little work,POSITIVE
Nothing else needs to be said... Finding artist I am looking for!,NEGATIVE
Great music selection easy interaction with app. Overall amazing expetience and premium with no ads...just great!,POSITIVE
Often times its deleting my dowloaded music even if im premium,NEGATIVE
"Lot of bugs, One of them is when you remove (-) a song and press next(>) in playlist--- It skips next two songs and plays",NEGATIVE
Very good app but I know they want to have money but it is somewhat frustrating to wait 1 hour just to change the song if you have changed it 6 times besides you can't choose because you have to be premium for Not having to listen to other songs and only listen to the one you want,NEGATIVE
"It's an Amazing app it's the only music app I use other than youtube. The only thing is sometimes the ad that gives you 30 mins uninterrupted listening bugs, But it's no big deal",NEGATIVE
Has anybody experienced the Mike Rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.,NEGATIVE
Reliable and loaded with the music I like,POSITIVE
"Excellent choices and variety, a go to for any music enthusiasts",POSITIVE
"Even without premium I can still enjoy my music, it's a very very nice and enjoyable app.",POSITIVE
"I really love Spotify, but I recently moved to Apple music because of payment issues. I wish you guys will support Google pay for payments.",NEGATIVE
"I still have Spotify, and the songs are great, but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because there wasn't very many ads before, and now there are SEVERAL. I get the same ads over and over and over. I'm sick of it! AND NOW Spotify had decided to give me THE EXACT SAME AD TWICE IN A ROW. Like, seriously?! I don't want Premium. I'm not paying $15.00 for that bullsh*t. Fix. This. NOW. I'm literally currently trying to find a different app to listen to music on, but so far nothing good. FIX IT! ðŸ˜ ",NEGATIVE
Wonderful music...all my favorites that I haven't heard in years,POSITIVE
"Everytime I save my music to the SD card, the app decides to reset the default storage to local storage. This has happened 3 times now. I hate having to redownload everything again. It's heavily inconvenient. Fix this please. Otherwise it's a great app",NEGATIVE
"Very comprehensive catalogue of music. The one thing that would improve the experience would be the ability to ""insert"" songs into playlists at a specific point rather than having to delete/remove songs and start again.",POSITIVE
Brilliant in every way. 11/10,POSITIVE
"Gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially Nonagon Infinity which is meant to infinity loop. Otherwise it's perfect. Also really good for learning lyrics to songs.",POSITIVE
"Spotify is currently useless, I can't pay for premium anymore. Its like they don't want my money anymore",NEGATIVE
"Great music on Spotify,would recommend.",POSITIVE
I think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that I love it :),POSITIVE
Spotify is a very good music app Just one thing about it if you have a Google Display it won't let you play all the Music you have to actually go on the app to hear the song I hate this I don't know if it is because of Google or Spotify and I don't know if this happens on Alexa but besides that it's a good music app for you to get,POSITIVE
"Found out a lot of new music & artists over years thanks to the ""Radio"" feature. Very nice algorithm, even though my taste is very wide (: One thing Spotify should improve (that bothers me daily & would also be very easy to perform in my opinion) - Enable ticking boxes so that we'd be able to add songs to multiple playlists at once, without the drag of having to press the ""more"" (3 dots) option over and over again!",POSITIVE
Look they asked nicely and I decided to rate it 5 stars it's really good,POSITIVE
In the 70's you had to flip the LP after every 5 songs! Then 80's CD's were... eject and insert the next CD. We've come along way baby!,NEGATIVE
Good Quality Sound best online ..but thank you Spotify by free share with friend....,POSITIVE
I love Spotify I get all the music I enjoy and even more I may have forgotten about in one place.,NEGATIVE
The app logged me out for no reason then deleted all of my downloads after sending me a forgot password link that never worked and when I did get in it logged me out immediately when I went out of the app. I had Wi-Fi the whole time as well,NEGATIVE
"I used to love this app, I was happy with the certain skips a hour but now three adverts before one song and worst part is, it is not even music from my playlist being played. I have certain playlists for each activity I'm doing or who ever is using my account and I don't like how when listening to my playlist, songs that aren't added start playing.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely ultimate music customized just for you. 15 year member,POSITIVE
Don't ask me I reaubscibed and now the plan I originally had I didn't pick this individual plan I had the share plan and all the music saved is no longer and also save nothing created 3 playlists sat the past 30 mins adding music not one song saved ? What's the deal,NEGATIVE
Please enable the capability of clicking on music labels within the credits.,POSITIVE
Good music and i love this app,POSITIVE
"UPDATE: Loads slower than molasses lately! ðŸ™„ Spotify is my ""GoTo"" music app!!!! I don't pay for the premium, I know! I do, however, feel leary about some of the security of the app and how it seems to have different music for 'suggestions' that are NOT relevant to me in anyway?? Sometimes, it even shows I've listened/watched things I haven't! With that being said, customer support could step up their game a smidge if possible for attending to inquires when emailed! Overall, ðŸ’•it!",NEGATIVE
Great app got all my favorite songs love the premium not happy about the price going up but whatever.,POSITIVE
Best choice of music.,POSITIVE
It was great but now on this new phone the app doesn't pop-up on the lock screen or the notification panel it doesn't show a preview of the current song,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify but sometimes annoying when I can't find a song I like lol. Hardly ever happens,NEGATIVE
"Device limit reach reached. Unable to download songs, no option to remove other devices, zero transparency on device count, 'sign out everywhere' does nothing and I have reached out to support. Spotify is awesome but this sucks. Show me my devices or let me remove them. Don't count old devices that have been offline for a year or more. Spotify apparently wants to burn money having this handled by their tech support department instead of providing an easy method for end-users.",NEGATIVE
"Love it,opens so many doors WOW!!",POSITIVE
Because of so much ads,NEGATIVE
Free awesome at least with ads it is free,POSITIVE
"Awesome, thank you so much for the service.",POSITIVE
The only music streaming app i use. 5/5,NEGATIVE
"I love this app! Great selection, great variety and very few advertisements. WOW I just can't say enough good things without being corny! !;-)",POSITIVE
"Probably the best music streaming app I ever used till now. It has so many features like - 1. You can make blends with your friends. Spotify can create a blend for 10 people ( that's a lot ) 2. To be honest, the ads are never too much, unlike some other apps where you get an ad after every 1 song. 3. It can play music in the background. 4. It also automatically starts a song if the song which you chose to play is done playing. Conclusion : I highly recommend this app",POSITIVE
The app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,NEGATIVE
Amazing music app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ’•,POSITIVE
Probably the best app for music streaming.,POSITIVE
Overall good app but to many ads,POSITIVE
In love they make music for all the crazy music I listen to they learned I have a happy mix and depressed mix and more that helps so much.. I totally recommend this app for everyone,POSITIVE
Some songs aren't available why? And there's a bug where I pause my music and the playback goes from 1:45 to 4:45 or even 0.,NEGATIVE
"It's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on Android, sometimes stops working when I lock my screen, or just stops playing. Bit dissapointing for a paid service. The general UI experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. Also no Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64 support is really REALLY quite lame.)",NEGATIVE
I love this app it is the best app for music in my opinion but I hate how I'm listening to a song it ends and a whole different song pops up not even in my playlist I get it's supposed to get you into new music but it is so annoying I can be listening to my favorite song I cannot wait for this next song I really like here's a song that I've never liked and the artist is not the best otherwise it's pretty good app,POSITIVE
I use it daily. I don't catch any problems.,NEGATIVE
If you want to listen to it and but it gives you 30 minutes of free listening and it will give you six skips just skip this song per hour and go to use them wisely but again a very good app,POSITIVE
The worst app I've ever been used . It's had show often same ads and after your mobile network issue the app doesn't support to play a single song.. That's why im1 uninstalling this worst app ...,NEGATIVE
"Has all of my favorite songs!! One thing.... it says ""no internet connection available"" when I try to play a playlist.. even when I do! Anyone else having this issue??",NEGATIVE
The App just isn't playing the music when i cast it to my tv.,NEGATIVE
Very intrusive app that don't respect privacy.,NEGATIVE
I am giving it 4 stars because it has problem that when I play music from my playlists it doesn't played plz look into this issue. And this app is very good for music . And I am deleting this app until issue resolved,NEGATIVE
"How about giving the option to listen to elevator music until the darn app open? Takes more than a minute to load up, really? It is truly the buggies app on my phone!",NEGATIVE
Not good after recent update. I can't see what song is playing and it pauses at every notification I get,NEGATIVE
Does this app just shut itself off when an update is available idk but it's getting annoying that i have to come back every 2minutes to hit play again!,NEGATIVE
This app service Very fast all song avaliable here Good works Spotify ðŸ’ŸðŸ’ŸðŸ’ŸðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥â£ï¸â£ï¸,POSITIVE
Updates always break the app stop updating so often,NEGATIVE
Fix the app. It keeps stopping and won't show on the notification bar.,NEGATIVE
Removing the Enhance feature from Like Songs makes exactly zero sense. Wish I could downgrade my version to get the feature again. Instead I have to fiddle by creating redundant playlists from my Liked Songs existing playlist.,NEGATIVE
"More commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! Your own greed will ruin you.",NEGATIVE
"App not working properly after latest update. No panel at bottom of screen to set sleep timer, and will stop playing after 5 minutes. Before this update I would use it every day, but just frustrating now, won't be using until fixed.",NEGATIVE
I like spotify but i hate that i can't just play my entire library without having to add songs to a playlist or like all songs. Can you just create a shuffle button to play all songs in a person's library?,NEGATIVE
I love this app BTS all songs available for Spotify ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
Very awesome app very easy to use,POSITIVE
I like their music without ads on their premium and I like their choices and my choices and it's enjoyable why I cook because I cook for a living and it's stress relieving and the music really helps,POSITIVE
"Generally fine. Not always as intuitive as the developers perhaps assume. Also hurry up and make a way to completely disable group sessions. If it's not something you want, the fact that someone in your group can change what you're listening to is very annoying. Especially when they don't even realize that they are doing it. See above for the app not always being as intuitive as developers assume",NEGATIVE
Premium user here and can't use the app. It keeps on crashing the plsy/pause bar dissappears I can't play podcasts for longer than 5 minutes. I can't move around my playlists. This has been going on for weeks now. I want my money back.,NEGATIVE
Can't see the bar to skip 15 seconds etc at the bottom of the app or when the app is closed.,NEGATIVE
THE worst app. first my account automatically Log out and then all my favourite songs are gone. I update this app but still nothing. And I'm also uninstalling this. ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤,NEGATIVE
"Just got the s22 ultra, and after opening the app, it just shows the logo and doesn't do anything else. I haven't even logged in to my account",NEGATIVE
"Just few words ""the best""",POSITIVE
I am getting sick of you guys changing what I am listening to when I press to play my liked playlist and you keep starting to play songs that are not on my liked playlist. I purposely choose to play my liked songs for a reason so stop changing it to play something that is not in my liked playlist. ðŸ˜¡ If I wanted to play random stuff I would say play suggested music but I don't hardly ever do that I just want the music I want to hear which is in my light playlist so stop messing with it. ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Love that I can pick my own music genre and make my own Playlist.,POSITIVE
I love being able to close out the app and open other apps and still listen to music,POSITIVE
"Love it... Always have all the music (artists, albums anything u desire) for any type of mood/situation....",POSITIVE
After the last update i dont have controls on pausing or seeing whats playing. It just plays and the only way of stopping is to force close the app. Samsung user,NEGATIVE
"The first few days it was a great app where I could listen to music freely, but now I have six skips an hour! And when I go on my playlist it says THEY ADDED STUFF ON MY PLAYLIST! That's my playlist! How are you gonna add songs that I don't even like! The songs that you add are not why I made the playlist! You're just ruining it, I'm going to a diffrent app. This one is just a waste of time, and money for people who use Spotify premium",NEGATIVE
This app is terrible if you want to be able to play your own songs that you own. If you want to radio that you cannot control in any way shape or form it's fine if you want a pod catcher great if you want to be able to actually play your music that you own it gives you a middle finger,NEGATIVE
"This was an extorinary music app. The biggest thing is whatever we like the song we can like and put it easly in playlist. So, I think is the best app to listening music ðŸ˜ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶",POSITIVE
Sometimes it lags,NEGATIVE
Any music or podcasts anytime anywhere!,NEGATIVE
Great app but I have been having issue like when I playy music the app closes it and when I open the app it won't let me even I tried everything also the 6 skips is too low to be honest especially I have to whatch 5 amount of ads which is ridiculous I hope this get fixed,NEGATIVE
Very nice app for music,POSITIVE
Awesome to hear music for freeâ˜ºðŸ˜˜,POSITIVE

My playlits are all empty but on my ipad they are all there help me plss,NEGATIVE

It was working fine for many months but nowadays I am facing frequent crashes.sometimes the app doesn't work at aal.,NEGATIVE
"I love the app. I wish we could edit better without premium, because some people cannot buy that, but it doesn't take away from the oppertunities overall. That is, if you can be patient.",POSITIVE
Too much advertisements..,NEGATIVE
"What a sad excuse to make me pay for subscription. This app is horrifically hard to use. It's like telling a 2 year old how to do things. You tell the app to play this song, but except it plays something completely different all because ""you didn't pay the subscription.""",NEGATIVE
"Previous issue got fixed, but now it plays a song, but doesn't change interface, so you can pause skip and so on...",NEGATIVE
Very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,NEGATIVE
All i can play are playlist,NEGATIVE
"I've noticed they use fake artist names on songs they got off of epidemic sound, not cool, they also have record labels using bots to Inflate artists views...",NEGATIVE
I love the way they go straight into the next song like it's being done by a dj,POSITIVE
"I have 3 Galaxy devices and it's the same over a of them. Stops playing constantly; probably about 10 times in a podcast. Randomly skips songs after the first 30 seconds. Have to reboot ap just to do it all over! Thought it was maybe my phone, but the ap is the same across all devices of mine and same complaints from my sister. I've had buggy aps, but I can say this is the least stable app that I have ever used.",NEGATIVE
Best apps and good idea for the first time,POSITIVE
Spotify the service is great for listening to music but their apps both for mobile and desktop are the absolute worst. I'm honestly thinking about switching to a different service just because of how absolutely terrible their apps are. They're always crashing or freezing and I need to keep restarting. Absolute nightmare.,NEGATIVE
Better than YouTube having a great meeting better than YouTube,POSITIVE
Love the app mostly of the time. Sometimes it glitches and will play songs (just a segment of the song over and . Sometimes it'll have two or three songs playing at the same time and I can't figure out how that's happening but for the most part I really like the app,POSITIVE
"I Love SpotifyðŸ™‚ they have every song in the world, love graphics and lyric option",POSITIVE

Everything is great but till rotation,POSITIVE
There are too many prblm with the quality of song as of changing quality to very high but still unsatisfied 101% much apk is resso I suggest to continue with resso,NEGATIVE
"Overall the app is pretty nice, but the ads are way too intrusive! Sometimes they show up just as soon as I start the app after a few hours of in activity or even first time in a day. This is not normal and user-friendly. Maybe give me at least a few tracks to listen, and then play your ads, would you? The ads shouldn't be the 1st thing that I see and hear.",NEGATIVE
This app is amazing. I like that they provide us new songs even though we are not premium members except the ads. Ads are not that frustrating. It comes every 30 mins which is very good. At last I would like to recommend this app for everyoneðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Hi since it is the 4th of July can u give all free users a 1 month premium plan because it is the 4th of July and I think it would be very generous of you guys to do that for the month of July!,NEGATIVE
I love this music and podcast app,POSITIVE
I enjoy using Spotify but it's extremely difficult to update payment details. I've been trying to do this via the app and web for the last one hour to no avail! Check it out asap.,NEGATIVE
Great job...now we can distribute our misic easy,NEGATIVE
"All of the sudden I don't get sound coming from the left speakers in my car. It only happens when in the car. Is this a Spotify app issue, car or both? I have a 2020 Hyundai Tuscon.",NEGATIVE
"Would have loved to give it 5 star. But their payment system in Bangladesh is kind of a mess. I've tried local debit cards from 2 banks, none of them worked and their support couldn't gave me a solution. Also they should introduce mobile banking/MFS payment like Nagad, bKash, Rocket, Upay etc in Bangladesh. They'll get at least 5 times more subscriptions if they introduce MFS payment in Bangladesh. I will update the rating to 5 star if they do this.",NEGATIVE
Super duper app.. amazing songs even u have gujarati songs and bhajans too ...that ur competative app doesn't have.. thanks,NEGATIVE

Just like how easy it is to use,NEGATIVE
"Sound quality is very good, if iam not using app then show adds no issue, but why r u showing adds to take premium, i will never take premium.",NEGATIVE
"If your looking for reveiws to prove to download this app, download it. But even so, I don't have premium and when I downloaded it, it had 1 ad every 30 minutes (or after I closed it out) but recently, it's been giving me 4 or more ads. It def great with premium tho, my brother has it.",NEGATIVE
"The shuffle playlist has to be improved. It keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music I listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why I get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. I hope u fix this, cuz I need a shuffle optionâ€”not selective.",NEGATIVE
Nice app song selection is gud,POSITIVE
Spotify is the best app ever you should try it It doesn't disappoint,POSITIVE
Can I subscribe to premium via Google play? Cannot find the options beside Visa and PayPal.,NEGATIVE

great music user friendly,POSITIVE
"Excellent platform for discovering new music, and I've had nothing but good experiences with their support.",POSITIVE
Very good music app,POSITIVE
"I have been using this for a few years now, saves time and gets me everything and more of what I'd like to hear. Two thumbs up for this app.",POSITIVE
EDIT: Changing my review from 5 star to 2 star. There are Tons of fake BOT playlists on Spotify and there is no way to report them. One of my Heavy metal tracks got randomly added to an EDM playlist despite not pitching there. EXTREMELY FISHY. Probably trying to tempt me into purchasing streams after I saw the amount of increase in streams. But it just hurts an Artists credibility. Spotify needs to allow us to report fake playlists. This drama of buying streams needs to end,NEGATIVE
Really great had a good time having a good timereally enjoyed it,POSITIVE
I can't figure out what email I am logged in under. It will not allow me to cancel my premium subscription. I'm going to cry. Fix your app.,NEGATIVE

Really good app. But I feel bad for aritists,NEGATIVE
Having a LOT of issues with the app just stopping all if a sudden. This has been since I made a family account.,NEGATIVE
Your app performance has fallen apart in the last few weeks. Regularly it forces me into offline mode now and doesn't have my full downloaded library despite being connected to working wifi. Regularly it fails mid song as well now. Sharing music is also not working across the board now. Previously everything worked and now it doesn't work well.,NEGATIVE
Im very entertaint with the variety Spotify provides! From amazing music to talk shows & up to date back stories....I'm very pleased I love that there is something for everyone to like & I will always be a loyal member.,POSITIVE

"Latest update automatically plays music upon opening the app when connected to a Bluetooth device??? EXTREMELY annoying, PLEASE allow an option to disable :(",NEGATIVE
ITS AMAZING I love how i can do whatever I want with my music!! I am speechless! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Brilliant app. I use it all the time. The only thing wrong with it is that for phone users the music is stuck on shuffle if you don't have premium. If you removed this it'd make the app better to use. Otherwise it's a handy thing to have.,NEGATIVE
Good. It just need better sound quality,NEGATIVE
"Enjoy listening to the songs I love. Each time I search for songs to listen to, I find ""new"" songs (oldies, but goodies) to add to my collection. And the ads are short and tolerable.",NEGATIVE

Good songs quality,POSITIVE
Fabulous except for adsðŸ˜…,POSITIVE
"I don't like the new update, I was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, I can't choose songs it was random and I need to listen till the end, I could skip but there was a limit to do that. Please bring back the old spotify",NEGATIVE
"This app was a huge hit and improved a lot. But personally, with each update this game makes me wanna cry. What's even 6 skips per hour? I'm not even gonna talk about the ads... This app just turned out to be a big disappointmen. Honestly at this point it's even better to pay for YouTube music premium",NEGATIVE
"Used to be 5 but now 1 star since recent update. Player stops randomly, doesn't show playing, can't start or stop, no controls need to shut the app constantly. Fixed by delete and redownload but then a few days later back to the same. Utter shite. Please give me the old version back.",NEGATIVE
"Ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just...

Huge collection and clear music is appreciated.,POSITIVE
Ever since the June 2022 update controls no longer work. The only way to pause or stop spotify is to close the app. Media controls indicate no media is playing when audio is playing.,NEGATIVE

music list Spr Sound quality Good Device Connected Like it And Play Music ðŸŽ¶ Good feeling,POSITIVE
"This app's updates are increasingly making it worse! The songs are very good even without the Premium version, but it makes it so that you will need to purchase it! Advertisements after a song ends once in a while is not that bad, but the main issue for me is the playlist customization. I can't rearrange songs, the playlist is always shuffled and sometimes it even plays songs that aren't even in the playlist for no reason! You can't even replay a song and it has a limit on skipping songs!",NEGATIVE
"Too many bugs, also I can't get the Spotify widget to stay on after a locked screen. I must unlock the screen, go into the app then change the song, pause etc... not worth the premium family membership fees. I have been a loyal customer for many years, now I think I'll change to another service or way to play music in my car unless it's fixed asap! STILL NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE....",NEGATIVE
Great app for great music. ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
"Every week, the app logs me out and I have to delete it and reinstall.",NEGATIVE

"This app is horrible you pick a song and it just make me listen to another song that I barely know probably it's cuz I use the the free kind but still it's horrible ðŸ˜±.

"Great app, van listern to music without wifi!!!!",NEGATIVE
"This app forces premium. I can live with ads and random shuffle, but now Spotify doesn't want to play my playlists I made anymore and spamms premium on me. It's very obnoxious and I can't recommend this app to anyone. I would pay if it was not this forced.. Currently a lot of bugs too.",NEGATIVE
"I've been using Spotify for a few years now, we've a family membership. It's great, I rarely find that they don't have a song/tune I'm after. I have my favourites, and every now and then I go through their suggested listening and sometimes find a new favourite. When I visit my Dad it's on with Spotify and we're filling the house with some oldies, such as Bert Kaempfert and James Last ðŸ˜€",POSITIVE
Good but if it was free it would have been the best which it is but I would like it if it is free,POSITIVE
"So far it has been nice,but I feel Spotify can do better by making videos available and also making singles available for individual download",NEGATIVE
Can u remove the shaffle that we can pick songs if we connect to a device or we play on our phones,NEGATIVE
"Previously was good. Recent times (a year - last months) various technical problems that continue. Audio stops playing randomly. You can also suddenly lose the control buttons of currently playing audio (you lose whole player view; audio controls and info what is playing and progress bar) and have to shutdown and restart the app to hope to get controls back etc. Now I noticed problems with skip buttons. Everything might work ok for a while, then problems continue.",NEGATIVE
Play bar/controls keep disappearing and I keep having to force stop the app to get it back. Tried reinstalling but the problem is still there,NEGATIVE
Best app to listen to your jams & today Download. It's so easy to use and premium is worth every penny,POSITIVE
I liked the Spotify that let me see the songs I had in my playlist.,POSITIVE

Stellar music recommendation algorithm one stars less.. for lack of individual song download options Also using my smartwatch controls leads to a bug where the currently playing song is wrongly displayed.... Edit Constantly downloading songs everyone and then,NEGATIVE
"What i hated here, is that, the premium feature, and random ads, And i cant click my own song, i can't skip, i can't click a song and it said i need to shuffle Music ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤§ðŸ¤§ðŸ¤§",NEGATIVE

Stuck on loading screen,NEGATIVE
Disappearing media controls (bug known since april 2022) still hasn't been fixed.,NEGATIVE
"Really great music streaming app, but it's unclear what qualifies as explicit in some cases",NEGATIVE
"Spotify was great until it stopped taking my credit card payments for premium Like JUST TAKE MY MONEY...PLEASEEE!!! Everytime I type in my credit card info it keeps saying ""payment can't be made. Country does not match payment option "". It matched for two months , what's the problem now?",NEGATIVE
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era",NEGATIVE
"Suddenly I don't have the ""shuffle play"" option on mobile anymore. I can choose a song and then it will shuffle the rest of the que, but I can't just hit play and have it shuffle to a song. I used to be able to and now I can't",NEGATIVE
Pushy and intrusive. Auto connects to Bluetooth devices with no option to stop it. Has soured the user experience.,NEGATIVE
For some reason lately the app won't show that it's playing and just crash. Gets really had to keep track of podcasts and playlists,NEGATIVE
"Very buggy on Galaxy S22. After playing something, the play band/navigation doesn't show up and thus can't switch output devices.",NEGATIVE
"The sound quality is very good and over all the app is amazing,but the ads...ðŸ˜©. The ads are freaking me out,an ad comes after a song.Its killing the mood",NEGATIVE
The like button for added favorite song is not user friendly please add some warring or confirmation to like or dislike a song,NEGATIVE
Downloads always seem to disappear when I need them,NEGATIVE
Paying premium for music that skips. Not happy,NEGATIVE
"I am paying for this app and there is this very basic feature missing. I can't remove my recently played podcast, song from the home page look. Why? Every app on earth has this feature, why can't Spotify? Please suggest how to do it. I don't want everyone to see what i listened last if they ever see my phone.",NEGATIVE
Fantastic Quality.. Amazing music collection!!,POSITIVE

"My Spotify keeps prompting offline even when on data. Have done troubleshoot, still same!",NEGATIVE
spotify is not connecting to the internet ... i already tried all the solutions .. and not working. i do have internet cause other apps are working. even spotify lite is working. its just this version of spotify.,NEGATIVE
"It's a nice app I enjoy it but it misbehave after using it for some time, it doesn't show playlist you can't select a specific song in the playlists available. I know the is need for upgrade to premium but the limitation you have put in place are not important you can find another way not denying people to select their song of choice. At least downloading for offline is enough limitation for those who are not on premium. Anyway it's a good app.",POSITIVE
I really like using Spotify.,POSITIVE
When I play a song not a Playlist it plays a different song not Evan by the artist,NEGATIVE
Been some problems with playback lately,NEGATIVE
Been using Spotify for years now. I really can't fault it ðŸ˜Ž,NEGATIVE
One of the better music streaming platforms; although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,NEGATIVE
It's a good app....I can choose a variety of songs for my exercise...just enjoy more music ðŸŽ¶ love Spotify â¤ ðŸ˜ it's addictive...,POSITIVE
I love Spotify because wherever I go and whatever I do I can listen to my favorite songs,POSITIVE
While it's fufills the needs of music when I make a playlist and I delete a added song it doesn't mean I want another one Spotify so ya the added songs really doesn't help when I have to pay 10 dollars(which I'll never do) just so I can listen to a song I actually enjoy. without skipping a couple of songs to hope to get the correct song I want to listen too,NEGATIVE
"Ever since the update, all playlists on spotify are telling me there is no music on then. But saying I can start a playlist. It's anoying.",NEGATIVE
Good app for songs,POSITIVE
Really good app. Can at music in the background without premium. Not much ads at all. Great app. Reccomend,POSITIVE
Spotify asking me to create an account and I already have one and doesn't automatically login now,NEGATIVE
"I loved Spotify before the most recent update because it would let me repeat the songs in my playlists that I like without having to shuffle and shuffling was only optional,also my music used to play without randomly stopping but now it does that often,I still love Spotify I just think the app was a bit better than before the most recent update,but this is all in my opinion.On the other hand, I like how you can listen to a piece of the song before you like it or put it in one of your playlists.",POSITIVE
Very good and very useful. I use it every day.,POSITIVE
Cannot play any song online. It just freezes and stops songs. It wasn't like this last week so i was wondering what happened. I tried reinstalling but it's still the same.,NEGATIVE
spotify give me better experience for life!,NEGATIVE
Spotify is not an app thats good to have without premium though if you use the web player it gets better but i like the app very much i don't really have feedback,NEGATIVE
It's a really good app for listening to music on the go but I dislike when random songs I don't know pop up randomly,NEGATIVE
Downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. It completely defeats the point of downloading...,NEGATIVE
Not so good. Unable to log in even if i m a premium member. Also not able to download music. Premium services are not available but debiting my account without giving me services every month,NEGATIVE
"Free version of Spotify is awful now, instead listening to add to get 30 minutes of music you get two songs and over a minute of ads. Also premium keeps going up in price it's a waste of money at this point",NEGATIVE
I liked it how it was in the beginning all this updating I don't like it messes it up,POSITIVE
It is the best song app,POSITIVE
I was just trying to logout and it made me leave the app and when I went back on it I couldn't even use it cause it kept me in the logo and this has been happening for 4 days now yall better fix this also fix the fact that we can't hear the sound while in suggest songs,NEGATIVE
The is very simple and smart to use,POSITIVE
"what the hell?? everything was okay untill the new update. this app is impossible to use rn, the songs are playing on shuffle all the time and now they shown like a sentence or something please fix this :(",NEGATIVE
Very Authentic in its own way,POSITIVE
I love the app don't give me wrong but the app has this problem of playing songs you don't want to listen to. For example I was playing my liked songs and it started to play songs that weren't on my liked songs. (Please fix this bug),NEGATIVE
I love that you can make your own playlists,POSITIVE
I love listen music and I love so many different choices!,POSITIVE
"Downloaded on my phone multiple times, it's not working. It's a black screen with the spotify logo but that's it. Will not do anything else. App is up to date, just not working.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best music app but adds are dispointed,NEGATIVE
It's gotten so bad recently The ads are so much Now the app also started to just stop Playing and needs to force shut down automatically.,NEGATIVE
Best quality of audio but sometimes the ad will come in front of audio,NEGATIVE
This app used to be great and the only thing I'd use to listen to music but now I can't login or else it crashes my phone and forces it to restart. I can't delete it because it crashes my phone and forces it to restart and so my only option would be to factory reset my phone.,NEGATIVE
So far so good. It's been amazing working with you all.,POSITIVE
"Horrible ad placing. Like there's literally 5 ads for every song. And they're not short 5 second ads no they're long as 30 second ads. That's a whole song worth of ads for every SINGLE song, like I'm not here for ads.",NEGATIVE
Very beautiful journey with Spotify,POSITIVE
"Positive part is your library. Anything you search and it is right there. If possible, don't increase the volume sharply while playing ads. It hurts sometimes.",POSITIVE
Nice except ads,POSITIVE
The app is great. I just don't know why the canvas feature doesn't work,NEGATIVE
"Music for free!!! and song's you love,plus it recamend's music of the same johnra,come on",POSITIVE
I love Spotify. Everything is easy to find and tailor fitted for my style of listening,POSITIVE
"I love how there are so many songs to play from Country to K-Pop, plus it has some amazing podcasts. I would rate it a 5 star, but the only thing is, is that you cant change how loud or how low the music or podcast is, ye you could just lower down your phone, but if you have other things, like if you were playing a game, you wouldn't be able to lower the music down so you can hear the game. But overall an amazing app.",POSITIVE
"I had a really good experience with Spotify But that was only when I had premium. when ur on the free plan u basically can't listen to music in the way you want at all. your playlist/songs are always on shuffle which is weird because sometimes you want your music in a certain order And then u only get 6 SKIPS an hour? So plus shuffle+ only 6 skips is already very strict. To add on you get 4 ads that are all 30 seconds, every 15 MINUTES. This is pushes people to other apps for a better experience",NEGATIVE
Easy to customised playlist. Wide variety of songs,POSITIVE
It's good music service the only issue I have is the premium adds I don't mind having regular adds or not having more skips but the constant shoving in your face adds for premium are bad,NEGATIVE
"New to this , but had a good time listening!",POSITIVE
"I want to stop downloading music because I'm not listening to it, but once I turn off the download, it continues to download, which is annoying because what's the point of turning off the download when it's still downloading? You should also include an easy-to-create playlist, such as my favorite songs. I put it on a playlist by category, but my patience isn't long enough to go through hundreds of songs one by one. There are many issues that can be improved. What a waste of money.",NEGATIVE
I love all the music but I hate podcasts. Literally less than zero interest in them but it's always shoving them in my face and often they have awkward pictures that I really don't care to see. The latest is they are in a language I don't even know so that's... cool... Would honestly give 5 stars if it weren't for that. I wish I had the option to remove the podcast section or at least dislike them so I don't have to see the awkward pictures.,NEGATIVE
Love this app. Easy listening has a lot of music and podcast anything ..its great.,POSITIVE
This app is very very good to enjoy music.,POSITIVE
Can be very frustrating to use at times. Ive had a old phone and now a new one. Same problems. Music rarely shows up what im playing on my home screen and sometimes doesnt show up at all on the spotify app when i clearly just select a song or podcast meaning i cant skip. To fix this you have to do a reinstall or logout login which fixes it for a time before going through the process again. I feel like they have also add a lot more shameless advertisement on podcasts for premium members.,NEGATIVE
Ok I can listen to my favorite songs and I don't need a premium I like the podcast,POSITIVE
Brings in the best music I need to hear.,POSITIVE
New like songs ui is ugly we need back old like songs ui ðŸ˜©,NEGATIVE

Best music app that I had used yet,POSITIVE
"Kept randomly pausing playing music and podcasts. Done everything to fix it but to no avail. Finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but can no longer access the application after that step. It remains stuck on the green logo and doesn't matter how long I wait, it stays there. I have done everything, cleared caches, forced stop, clean reinstallations, checked for updates on app and phone (Samsung s10), everything, and nothing works. Only this app has stopped working. I am a Premium user.",NEGATIVE
Easy to use app. Great to listen to the music you like.,POSITIVE
"Have large amount of song to choose from. However, its hard to just want to listen only to specific track",NEGATIVE
Cannot update my premium. It always try to connect evn tho there is nothing wrong with the network.,POSITIVE
It's the best music streaming I've used so far and cheap,POSITIVE
If u pay for it it is a great ap to use but if u don't pay for it it will add songs in ur playlist and only give u 6 skips per hour,NEGATIVE
"Love it, so easy to listen to your favourite songs!",POSITIVE
"worst possible app. constant bugs and issues, shuffle is a joke, and the weekly recommendations are at least 50% songs i already listen to. premium is losing its worth every day.",NEGATIVE
less ads would be great but I understand that you can't do that,NEGATIVE
I've been using this app for over 5 years. It's just recently started to go on another playlist once you've finished the end of your playlist it goes on to another playlist which is really annoying. But other than that issue it's a great app for music if you don't want to pay for iTunes and this is why I'm rating this app 4 stars,POSITIVE
"I enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. I wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but I make it work. Quality has always been good! The one or two times it messed up after an update I cleared cache, forced stop and the reopened the app. Simple enough!",POSITIVE
"It's a really good app and I love it! The only minor concern I have is the ads, but that's all! â¤",POSITIVE
"Grate for tunes, great vibes man ðŸƒðŸ’¨",POSITIVE
Loving it! Took me this long to try it but it was worth the wait,POSITIVE

Absolutely incredible. Keep up the good work.,POSITIVE
"Very good, one of the best music experience I have had.",POSITIVE
"Honestly, I like spotify, but I've noticed a new bug: When I don't use spotify, and cancel any music, random music starts playing every 1 or 2 hours. This never happened to me, a few months back. Now it's happening constantly",NEGATIVE
Impossible to use liked songs will only play in shuffle controls are unbearable and the app is stuck on one song and will not let me play any others,NEGATIVE
Update has made it keep skipping its ridiculous,NEGATIVE
"Glitches CONSTANTLY, pauses ALL THE TIME. Def don't pay for a paid membership. What a joke. Worst money I've spent this year. Fix your app Spotify. If I could give you 0 stars I would.",NEGATIVE
"Just another way to be spied on by people with ðŸ’© intentions- I miss the 80s You can laugh, but at least our every move isn't on candid camera, all our likes & dislikes are monitored. Technology is a donkey. Wait, that's mean to donkeys... You get the point- Enjoy your shower! May as well do it on the front lawn!!!! ðŸ¤ª",NEGATIVE
It's alright I do have issues When looking for music Some you don't have when I try look for them,POSITIVE
I want to cancel my membership but there is no where in the app to do so,NEGATIVE
"It has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",NEGATIVE
"To the person or team worked on the search, nicely done! I normally only notice things when they don't work well or break, but the Spotify search is smart enough to match lyrics too, as well as correct common mistakes",POSITIVE
Spotify playlist is perfect,POSITIVE
Where did the play now bar go?!?! Also I can't flag offensive ads and dislike them. Suggested songs for Playlist should be an option. Otherwise good app. Thanks,POSITIVE
Had premium for 7 years. Found my favorite music and the style that makes my life better.,POSITIVE
Stop hijacking my lock screen with album art! I don't want everyone to know that I'm listening to the Frozen soundtrack ðŸ˜‚,NEGATIVE
Great app listen to it all day everyday,POSITIVE
Very good choice of music. Easy to understand and use. Plenty of playlists to choose from.,POSITIVE
More problems than any other streaming service. Even Deezer is more reliable.,NEGATIVE
"Your app needs a MAJOR redesign.The Joe Rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. Try a redesign of the UI that makes sense. That makes it easier to discover new things.Make it a more social and Connected network. Some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.DARK AND LIGHT MODE. I can go on forever.Pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for iOS and Android at the same time.Give users control.windows Xp media player visualisation.",NEGATIVE
When I play a podcast most of the time now it doesn't have the page to set a timer or fast forward the podcast etc. Considering I'm paying premium I expect better,NEGATIVE
I hate this app like there is a couple times when the Wi-Fi is strong but then it's still having problems working like it has its times when it doesn't work the way it's supposed to meaning the music won't work or the music will glitch which is why I hate this app other than that it's a pretty bad app it even shows lyrics which is good if you want to learn the lyrics of the song.

"Was amazed with the customizing and shared info how awesome the choice of music was, as sometimes it can be humiliating, it's more relevant. I believe in this, and music helps me more then words can explain. This is one app I love and recommend.",POSITIVE
75% of the content you'll be listening to here is back-to-back ads. I hope there's a way to delete my account somehow....,NEGATIVE

"Fantastic app. Had it for years, only sucks when your broke for a bit you lose playlist but they do keep it until your back on top. Great quality sound.",POSITIVE

I go to shuffle to play the full version and it plays a song i did not even bother to choose. I think its unfair to those who cant go to premium because i cannot be paying every month , its useless.

I decided to make a Playlist and after 3 songs that I added myself a random song that wasn't my taste just started playing. Also when I searched up a song and clicked on it the song itself didn't play, I had to skip 7 times to get to it.",NEGATIVE
Much better now but still lacking in a few ways. I still really want the option to fine tune what kind of tracks play in a radio and to have a supermix for when I want to listen to a little bit of everything and not sure what exactly to listen too.... Edit: now just crashes on my a53 kinda disappointed,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, especially when I have premium",POSITIVE
Love that I can find ANY song... Going down memory lane!,POSITIVE
"I got Spotify Premium a few months ago. At the Beginning, everything was fine. A few crashes here and there. Now not even the currently played song is correct - like: how. Moreover buttons partially need minutes to react. Spotify tells me over and over again I got no connection, though everything else Internet related works just fine. The SD Card implementation just works for a part. The app is laggy, crashes and basic functions stop working over time. Please start working on performance & fixes",NEGATIVE
After last these last few updates it's become incredibly glitchy,NEGATIVE
Can be better. Algorithms can be improved.,NEGATIVE
Over adds while during using the app,NEGATIVE
"Love it but the button to report explicit content don't work. I don't mind the explicit content but it's nice to hit the block explicit button around the kids. Sucks when bad words get through. IT'S BEEN YEARS, FIX IT!!!",NEGATIVE
"Great ðŸŽ¶ selection, a partnership with Boost so you don't use up your data, easy peasy to use. You can listen to whole albums",POSITIVE
I can enjoy the music I choose.,POSITIVE
Spotify has a large library and you can almost find every 9 out of 10 songs quickly. Spotify has become my favorite brand because of the service and overall experience. I've Premium Service so I never get hit by any ads while enjoying the music in very high quality. ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Galaxy S21 + .....Music has now started to stop/pause for no reason during playback. Have tried everything and still continues to happen.,NEGATIVE
"Never plays the songs that are actually on the Playlist I selected, even when I search specific songs it plays ones I don't want. On the rare occasion it plays the song I do want to play, it only plays 3 seconds of the song. If I could rate 0 stars, I would. YouTube is a better app for music than thus garbage",NEGATIVE
Its is good but we can't download song without any purchase,POSITIVE
The sharing option not working properly.,NEGATIVE
"Mine just stop opening this July 2022, Its stuck at loading screen (spotify logo) and doesnt open the app at all. Tried uninstall/install - clear data/cache - phone is up to date - app is also up to date. Please support ðŸ˜”",POSITIVE
Great music options and I don't mind the adds,POSITIVE

Literally have to reinstall this app everyday. It just doesn't work. Probabally should end my membership. This is garbage.,NEGATIVE
This app is really good I really like this app This is really easy to find any song of blackpink and BTS I really like this appðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Recently the app has gotten really buggy - random pauses in the middle of a song or podcast, sometimes songs won't start playing, etc. Today's update is even worse and has made it so I can't even open it up. It just sits there and loads endlessly. I usually love Spotify, but the app is currently unusable. I'll update my review once they fix it.",NEGATIVE
Great app I could listen to my favorite playlist and I can turn of my phone while the music doesn't stop when the phone is on lock screen.,POSITIVE
Good app but now song lyrics wrong having à®ªà®¾à®Ÿà®²à¯ à®µà®°à®¿à®•à®³à¯ à®¤à®µà®±à®¾à®• à®‰à®³à¯à®³à®¤à¯ *Note this*,NEGATIVE
Its music. All the music. No BS except Neil Young and southern man don't want him around anyhow.,NEGATIVE

"Easy to use,brilliant songs & artists.",POSITIVE
"I can't change the order of my playlist, also some of the lyrics are wrong and I can find all the songs that I want",NEGATIVE
It been pretty cool wish that i had more than six skips but it fine like the app.,POSITIVE
"Since the last upgrade, 6.28.22 Spotify no longer works.",NEGATIVE
"Idk what happened but recently it's been God awful. Affects Bluetooth, keeps cutting out, connection issues. It's just Spotify app having that problem They could use a few additional features(especially on their radio channels) but ultimately the best listening experience. It's great how they recommend songs.",POSITIVE
So easy so navigate.,POSITIVE
This is a great app but at times it just refuses to launch. Has been like this on and off for a couple months now. Slightly frustrating.,NEGATIVE
"Highly unresponsive after you open Spotify from overview press at bottom screen. You have to either shut it down and launch it again or wait for it to load for almost 15 seconds, then the app wakes up and starts running. Very annoying and have to press almost 5 or 6 times to play a song.",NEGATIVE
Love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. Use it on Wi-Fi for tunes on our Harley and our patio. Uses very little battery.,POSITIVE
"A great app for music streaming, has a great free feature allowing basic music streaming, then the premium version is awesome allowing ad free and higher quality music streaming; While also being able to go offline.",POSITIVE
Can't just download 1 song from album when rest of album is rubbish amazon you can and so much simpler to use,NEGATIVE
If I don't have premium and I try to listen to the songs on my playlist it playing songs that are not on the playlist. I would suggest that you fix that so that we can just listen to the songs on our playlist than listening to something that is not on the playlist,NEGATIVE
"Decent but......this app has potential to be great BUT the podcasts stop on every single podcast out of the blue, I have to keep manually hitting play which is not feasible to working in a clean room and not being able to touch your device. Please fix. Also, it'll play podcasts I've previously listened to and deleted randomly. Annoying!!!!",NEGATIVE
Greatest music service ever.,POSITIVE
Playback always stopped suddenly,NEGATIVE
"I generally enjoy Spotify, but lately it's been doing this thing where if I'm playing music on a playlist, it will play random songs that are definitely NOT on that playlist. Very annoying.",NEGATIVE
Perfect companion during long travels.. ðŸ‘ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
"I wish it had less commercials but other than that I love the sound, the quantity of music and artists. A pretty nice app.",POSITIVE
Impossible to listen to offline playlists unless started on wifi.,NEGATIVE
"i enjoy my spotify premium, It lets me play musics I want and gives me a time of my life. But when using another app or playing some as background music, The player keeps crashing everytime It plays only 1 song. Its annoying how i need to go back to spotify and play it again. But it repeats the crashing too, please fix this. My money is worth nothing if this doesn't even get fixed.",NEGATIVE
"I've only just started using Spotify, but I enjoy it. It plays the music I enjoy and, so far, no repeats.",POSITIVE
"Has gotten better over time, but certain bugs like shared playlists not showing up in the list have been present for ages.",NEGATIVE
Won't play anything that I select. It just gives me a black screen. A little mad since I just paid for premium.,NEGATIVE
This music app is really good ðŸ˜†,POSITIVE
I love the update but.... my pc account dont have premium stuff but i have it purchased just fix it please. But that it have good song up to 10 million songs.,POSITIVE
"The worst, most unstable app I've ever used for Android. Audio goes out when screen turns off, audio controls frequently crash while playing, integrated ads crash podcasts, audio skips, etc. I want to support Spotify because of commitment to free speech, but such an awful, unstable POS makes it a challenge.",NEGATIVE
This service is great but the app crashes and causes the app I am using to crash.,NEGATIVE
"Don't know why I'm paying for subscription, none of my downloads are available, it'll say downloaded, show how many i have, but nothing is available to play while i am out of cell and wifi range. Everything works when i have connection, but i download shows and music so i can play when out of service, which is like more than half of my life working in remote Alaska. Downloaded items should be available without a connection. Now after update, even with connection, i can't play anything",NEGATIVE
I like the app because it takes lesser time to find songs,POSITIVE
"I love Spotify, but when I need to update it, my whole computer breaks (My computer isn't old at all, in fact it is only 6 months old) It can be extremely laggy, but I love it nonethless ( I just wish it didn't lag so bad and break my computer)",NEGATIVE
Lovely and the best app ever yo hear music. Thx for creating this app ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Ok I've resorted to begging because it's literally impossible to make playlists without being able to hear a sample of the song in the add section. Please. Just add that back and I will give 5 stars thats all I want. Why would you take that away. The only reason I dont switch music apps is because of how many playlists I already have at this point. BLEH. the bare minimum has been restored.,NEGATIVE
"great app, it's just when I click on a song it usually plays a random song.",POSITIVE
Have used this app since launch and love it!,POSITIVE
Easy to work,POSITIVE
"app can't be opened, it was take long time to load. can u fix that problem asap?",NEGATIVE
"Too many ads, I understand that if I don't have premium I will need to see ads but there are too many! I already learned the Disney plus ad and I had no intention in learning it!",NEGATIVE
After every update it becomes worst Because ads increase almost after 2 song ads start. And it irritated everyone ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž . Now I feel that downloaded song in your device is better to use this..... ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,NEGATIVE
"I hope you add data saver where the lyrics and background videos dont play, For data users sake. And also i hope you give random related songs suggestions when we play so we can explore more like in Yt music app",NEGATIVE
I learned ro sing my gav songs on this aap its so good and there are relaxing asmr sound,POSITIVE
I'm frustrated I can't listen to music no more I tried everything I uninstall it waited two hours to have the screen pop up it's just the Spotify icon the whole time I can't login or anything I looked up how to troubleshoot I tried everything I don't know what's wrong I'll change the rating till it works,NEGATIVE

This app is awesome really recommend it from other people really good music app ðŸ˜Ž,POSITIVE
Great radio app love it just what I really want to continue to use.,POSITIVE
I've had a very good listening experience with Spotify I think it would be nice if I had the option to make it have more bass or to be louder on my Android phone like it does on my IPad but it is what it is!,POSITIVE
I think that Spotify is good but it doesn't have so many songs that I like but is still good,POSITIVE
Too many Ads in it,NEGATIVE

"Your app sucks... The autoplay doesnt work, I get to hear more ads than music... And I don't understand that why does the autoplay have so much issue... Update: The Auto Play still sucks... Update 2.: Now the app refuses to start... Update 3: Player has become buggy... Update 4: Repeating songs in discovery queue... Update 5: Your App Player is dead...",NEGATIVE
"I have been using this app for over a year but, recently the app has gone down hill. The ability to preview songs before adding them to playlists was removed making it 10 times harder to form a good playlist. Then there is the issue with the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening."" It has never and probably will never be 30 minutes which just makes it unbearable to listen to. nvm its back now ads still suck though",NEGATIVE
"This is the best app for alone vibing but the one thing is we can't download songs, we should have a premium account",NEGATIVE
Excellent app but please get rid of the ads.,NEGATIVE
"ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥, jus need more bronx drill , a lit more.. ðŸ—½ðŸ‘¿",NEGATIVE

First you could choose songs from between your playlist and put your favourite songs but now you have to wait for you to listen to that song it's not how it used to be alot more things I would like to tell you but I won't I'll let the rating decide my experience,NEGATIVE
"I used to love this app. But after the update I'm hating this. The song which i want to listen, which i play it gives u another song. It's really annoying. I can't listen the songs which i want to listen. If you can't listen to your favourite songs, then what's the point to use spotify? It says you can only skip the song if you buy the premium one. Dude i donâ€™t want to buy the premium one. Before updating this app it was too good but what happend after the update. Itâ€™s really annoying",NEGATIVE
Unable to dismiss the advertisements .. fix it,POSITIVE

One of the worst pain in this app is getting stuck on the loading screen it takes so long or forever. Please fix it.,NEGATIVE
Love! ðŸ’œ Highly recommend. -Francesko the Artist,POSITIVE
"It has been great since I purchased premium but some of my songs don't get downloads I don't know what is wrong, can't see lyrics when offline and some of the songs are know where to be found like Park Jimin's promise and others. Before premium was hell like it has more ads than any other apps I've ever encountered, at one point i thought i might break my phone when ads came out of nowhere but everything is good now I guess except for those things i mentioned right above.",POSITIVE
I hate this app because you literally have to wait an hour just to skip a song,NEGATIVE
Excellent app. Keep improving with new features,POSITIVE
It's free music and all but there need to be a membership for ads if you are looking into it so do download and enjoy,NEGATIVE

Love the very much-loved tunes,POSITIVE
I try to put on a Playlist and it says (this Playlist is empty) & when I put a song on it doesn't play. Spotify better be on the verge of fixing this cause it's the summertime I need my music Don't piss me off Spotify Get it fix,NEGATIVE
"great app, my only grievance would be that my favourite musical isnt on spotify, but thats understandable considering its extremely niche. anyways please whichever spotify representative reads this please contact william finn about getting In Trousers onto spotify.",NEGATIVE
Bro ðŸ’€ i tried downloading the app today and try it out but it can't even open Lmao ðŸ’€ plus i used to use Spotify and it would keep playing random songs and when i search up something there's always different results,NEGATIVE
Sometimes it plays and won't pause or pull up the play bar when listening to podcasts. Im new to Spotify and im wondering if I should find a different app to use. Seems to to have bugs that need fixed.,NEGATIVE

Best ever Music app ever seen this kinda of app. It's so rocking. But the ad disturbs you seriously..,POSITIVE
We don't all have bank accounts for premium. NOT OUR FAULT. At least create a physical account so we can deposit cash with reference to our email or OTP or something..,NEGATIVE
Even when I have premium I don't get premium features,NEGATIVE
Continue to have problems with app not stopping play. App will say nothing is playing but there it is definitely playing. I have to go into settings and force stop the app. Also will do the opposite. I will open the app and can't get anything to play and will have to force stop the app. Then it seams to work for awhile.,NEGATIVE
I paid for premium and am getting commercials. WHAT A SCAM!,NEGATIVE
Every thing is okay but only if you could make it usable without much data.,NEGATIVE

I have rock with Spotify from day one and they are the only music app that i will ever deal with. They are the best at what they do. I highly recommend Sporify to everybody.,POSITIVE

Realy nice app. I can hear music very clearly.,POSITIVE
When I logged out it never opened again. I reinstalled and restarted my phone. It's still stuck at the spotify logo screen.,NEGATIVE
"While I think that Spotify deserves way more stars, I do habe some problems with the app in general. For example, while in Offline Mode, the app will repeatedly reset all downloaded songs, so that it simply doesn't work. The Playlist I've downloaded shows the little icon at the top that it's all downloaded, but when I scroll down, the songs just don't play and neither do they have the little download icon. It's just really annoying me because then I have to redownload the songs and use Data",NEGATIVE
Amazing if it was totally free,POSITIVE
Good functions well designed,POSITIVE
"When i am listening to music it keeps on randomly pausing the music for a split second the carries on playing it, or I have to turn on my phone to stop it from doing that. I have the latest update and it still does it. I think it is still experiencing glitches.",NEGATIVE

Spotify is good because it's got all my favourite songs on.,POSITIVE
Laggy and doesn't open,NEGATIVE
"It was fine until that auto shuffle happened, if i try to play from my liked Playlist, it plays songs that I never heard before. It won't let me play other songs without it being in playlist shuffle either. It would be fine if that wasn't added, Let people enjoy listening to the music they like and not have to pay for premium to stop that auto shuffle.",NEGATIVE
Pauses for no reason and podcasts just refuse too play at all,NEGATIVE
The best music streaming site there is!,POSITIVE
"Wonderful music to listen to, anytime",POSITIVE
"Ads are frustrating but Spotify always makes it easy to get a trial or extend user membership. The most user-friendly app for music and podcasts, in my opinion.",POSITIVE
"I have used my Spotify on numerous devices over the years. That being said, Spotify has always been a challenge to play music and podcasts in areas with less than great cell service. Web pages and YouTube videos will load but Spotify will not. Very frustrating when I pay for this subscription. Saved music and podcasts take extremely long to register when offline and will often tell me ""no connection "" Overall I love the content so I will keep paying",NEGATIVE
"nice app,though can you stop shuffling my songs with other songs that i dont want to listen to?",POSITIVE
Best live music streaming app I've ever utilized. I couldn't find any shortfalls not to rate it 5*****!,POSITIVE

"This app is amazing. I think this is the best ever song cloud,every song is on..OMG!..its amazing.",POSITIVE
Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it,POSITIVE

It's very nice how can I describe it I don't know but is one problem that it is just when the internet but not with offline so I will give it 5 star,POSITIVE

Best music streaming service out there!,POSITIVE
"Awesome ,Ifonly they had kiwi classics like south side of Bombay would be a 5.",POSITIVE
"I really love using Spotify, but for the past few days the app isn't opening at all. Until this isn't rectified, my review will be one star. Otherwise the app is great to use. Really sad about not being able to listen to my playlists.",NEGATIVE
Should have left the equalizer on there. If that was left then a 5 star all day.,NEGATIVE

Spotify's is an amazing app to listen to music but the only problem is that we can't keep the songs in the order we wish for and there is a big problem of ads in between....We can't break free of ads until we upgrade to premium...,NEGATIVE

This is the best song recommendation app. Also you can listen to podcasts which are very well designed.,POSITIVE
"Since last update I have lost control of how I can play music, it stops for no reason, there is no play pause buttons anymore.

Good but some songs missing in list,NEGATIVE
I bet it would be better if you can add GIF photo to your playlist,NEGATIVE
"Use every day on a paid for choice, so no ads. Just add to my play lists as and when. No drop outs & used the downloads option while on holiday so didn't have to worry about Wi-fi or data use.",NEGATIVE
"Its a great music app, i really love it but my suggestion is, could you make an update where we could download 1 song and not the entire album, because if we have to download all the song in the album, its really consuming our storage on our phones.",NEGATIVE
Changed my review because the app didn't work for me. I accidentally logged out from my acc but when I tried to login again the app just blank(black). Nothing. I've restarted my phone and reinstall the app but still the same thing happened.,NEGATIVE
That is a good music app,POSITIVE
It used to be a great app but now it just became bad. You have to watch atleast 5 videos after a song and you only get 6 skips an hour (a ridiculously low amount). When you find the song you want it ridiculously plays a different song by another singer instead the song you want. I'm not sure how you guys get payed to do this but you need to fix it now.,NEGATIVE
"It's awesome ,but too much ads interupt",NEGATIVE
"What happened to Spotify it's not the same, whenever i choose a single or album the songs are not there and when i it different music will play",NEGATIVE

"I don't what happened But all of the sudden it Stop working So, i tried to restart the app but it now just show a blank screen i tried about 15 installing and uninstalling it but still won't work",NEGATIVE
It's great. All the music I could ever wish for.,POSITIVE
"Great, but I was hoping to be able to change podcasts while driving, but that seems dangerous.",NEGATIVE
"It's a great app, i just wish the playlists were not shuffled by songs that are not in the playlist",POSITIVE
It so good 10/10 the best place to lease to music,POSITIVE
"Frequent crashes, also I pay for the premium and still get advertising for the JRE!? Still better then pandora but maybe not worth buying.",NEGATIVE
"""Offline Mode"" is the biggest useless feature ever. I might actually cancel my Spotify acct over the amount of times I've tried to listen to my DOWNLOADED music while away from data service and CANT. HOW USELESS.",NEGATIVE
My experience with Spotify is great. I love this platform. Thanks Spotify team.,POSITIVE
WAS a good app. Until you couldn't play the song without shuffling. And the layout is different. I advise you to go back to YouTube music. At least could play a song. :(,POSITIVE
"Great, love the choices and suggestions",POSITIVE
Fantastic range of easily accessed music,POSITIVE

This is best listing app I ever seen,POSITIVE
I wish I didn't have to use data whenever I wanted to listen to all my songs at once,NEGATIVE
"I can't live without Spotify,i love it",POSITIVE
The app is so useful. You can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything. Songs makes emotions more valuable. But I think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit that's why I am giving it 4 for now but It will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed. The song quality is so good that's why I will recommend to use this app for sure.,NEGATIVE
You have to buy there stupid premium just to play a single song I literally have to go through 20 songs just to get to the one I want,NEGATIVE
"Iâ€™ve been a Spotify user for a long time, but just this year Iâ€™m having some discomfort using Spotify. My internet network is very good, but itâ€™s hard to play music",NEGATIVE

"It bothers me that when you don't have a premium when the ads come on they sound 10 times louder than the music sounds, which is a problem when you listen to music with a speaker or with headphones, because it forces you to turn up the volume because you don't listen to the song and then feel like you're going deaf from the commercials",NEGATIVE
Great music of the 70s and 80s,POSITIVE

Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"It's a great app but there are so many adds inbettwen the songs, albeit they only pop up after about 3-7 song or if you restart a song. But I've had I up to 8 ads in a row before my next song began to play, and the ads could range from 15 to 30 seconds. But the audio is great and all the options in the settings are enjoyable. So, the main thing is want changed is the huge amount of ads, after all they take up more time then most of the songs themselves! It's just overkill at this point.",POSITIVE
would be 5 stars but when I'm playing music when I've listened to every song it plays random songs,NEGATIVE

Spotify without premium is very stupid,NEGATIVE
...'plugged' in a few artists and get more artists and tunes I like.,POSITIVE
"Horrible experience. Ads middle songs. Middle my sleeping med. music. Wakes me up in shock, coz its super loud and out of context. Impossible to rewind the song or play again. Its like fnk app try to tell you how to listen to your music. Its pathetic. If there would be server, jumping in every 5 min in my coversation to promote menu unless i pay 5 bucks, id break his nose.

Best music app there is nothing beter,POSITIVE
My translator disappeared and also there's no karaoke option,NEGATIVE
"Spotify keeps stopping mid song after I start. Happens sometimes every song, sometimes every 3rd but always happens. I'm the only one who uses it, cleared cache, uninstall and reinstalled, dont use power saving mode ever, have perfect Internet, deleted all my data and saved and started over and it CONTINUES to happen. I PAY for this, if its not fixed in the next couple of days I'm cancelling my subscription because this is pathetic at best.",NEGATIVE
Best music and it has all the music u like,POSITIVE
"Terrible, you can't even pick an exact song without paying $10 a month, just get YouTube vanced, it has way better selection, you have the freedom to pick the actual song you want to listen to and there's no ads.",NEGATIVE
"I use spotify on a phone and ,oh boy, it's a nightmare. First of all there's a ridiculous amount of adds,you only get six times to skip a song and it resets in an hour, and you can't pick what song you listen to, there's only shuffle.",NEGATIVE
Stop adding songs to the Playlist i create if I wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs! I created my own Playlist so I don't have to use my skips looking for a song I want. Very disappointing the app would be great if this was fixed. Don't wast your time getting frustrated.Please fix this,NEGATIVE
Listen to good music and old music,POSITIVE

"The app is not bad overall, just the fact that it takes a few days for lyrics to be uploaded after a song has been released. Also not all songs have lyrics. Bhorex",POSITIVE
They gave me 6months free trial and so far love it,POSITIVE
The media player outside of the app and the progress bar inside the app disappear way to frequently. I have to hard quit the app multiple times to resolve the issue.,NEGATIVE
"Annoyed by how many unstable ads there are and decided to review about it specifically. I get around 10+ ads in a row and only 2-3 songs. Maybe 5 ads in a row at least. This is normal when I play music, and it shouldn't be. Rare for my playlists to have no ads for 30 minutes as Spotify states. It used to not be this messy. Please code whatever to fix this, it's an everyday situation. I shouldn't jump from each playlist to try and find the right spot to get ""30 min free listening.""",NEGATIVE
Add a damn option to confirm whether you want to connect to a certain Bluetooth device or not. Had too many occasions where the options for connections would bounce all over the place due to constantly finding and forgetting ones only to mis-click away from the thing I wanted instead to a device someone else is always using. Awkward to use and inconvenient.,NEGATIVE
It just stopped working,NEGATIVE
After two or three song they give a long add which is really anonning .when I use the first there will have add but add remain after the 30 min,NEGATIVE
"This app is good. But for some reason, The Shuffle is always on... But when the PC version comes into use, it's always off. Is the songs policy always behind a paywall or you guys just want to get money by premium... This isn't why ""Free"" streaming apps are for... The shuffle isn't helping you by you're problems.... It's just making the listener's mood and their problems unsolvable...",NEGATIVE
I've had the same Spotify premium for 6 years and let me tell you. WAYYYYYY better than apple music or Amazon whatever it's called. 10/10 recommend. Keep up the good work Spotify. I love you â£ï¸,POSITIVE
The only problem is when you dont have premium it gives you like 6 ads at a time,NEGATIVE
"Great , affordable Music app!",POSITIVE
"Podcasts turn off by themselves, sound plays without app controls",NEGATIVE

I absolutely love this app. The free version is amazing and premium is even better. I get to listen on the way to work and simply whenever I want. There's music for everyone. As a lesson whose tastes varie from day to day and are simply all over the place I'm very satisfied. They also have people who are willing to help if there are any issues. 10 our of 10 in my opinion.,POSITIVE
Too many ads. It's annoying.,NEGATIVE
"Its the best especially, if you have premium.",POSITIVE
I love every aspect of this app!,POSITIVE
"Great at finding songs, and making recommendations.",POSITIVE
"There's no order to shuffling, you'll be listening to an up-beat song and suddenly an extremely depressing song comes on, it really ruins the mood. I'm sure if they can organize their playlists into upbeat and sad songs, they can organize their shuffling.",NEGATIVE
"This app has lots of podcasts and I love those , you can also try these podcasts of Crime & Thriller.",POSITIVE
"Hi this app I great but it keeps adding songs I don't want on my playlist and it's really annoying because I don't like them. Please fix this, thankyou",NEGATIVE

Lately the app has this pause thing going on whilst listening to some music. Once thought it's my headphones but it was not,NEGATIVE
"If I could rate this a 0 I would, My name is Hannah and I'm 11 and I absolutely hate this app. I downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when I tried to delete it of it said that I couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after I down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. I'm never downloading again",NEGATIVE
Its perfect Music To use for study or for fun some to use to dance to and sing to it is perfect,POSITIVE

"App doesn't perform well, but I like the layout and the features",POSITIVE

Wont let me play my songs and keeps playing other songs.,POSITIVE
Everything is v.well but when i search a song then single song isn't shown as search result then i played album then it's auto set on loop then the song isn't played another artist song played i don't know why but please change this feature or guide user.,NEGATIVE
Really good app to listen to music with! Downside is that you need mobile data to listen to music when you don't have Wi-Fi and to get no Wi-Fi/mobile data needed to listen to it you need to pay and some people are broke as *cough cough* me *cough cough* ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE

Spotify changes my playlist to music I did not select. I find this annoying,NEGATIVE
Sad to say that since the latest Samsung phone update Spotify will not work. It appears to be connected showing green moving bars on the tune selected but is mute. Also the app appears frozen as it is not possible to start or pause.,NEGATIVE
The first app which is bestest for listening musics,POSITIVE
Excellent job with lyrics. Love this app â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
A have a lot of problems with it but the most important is the fact that I can't search up a song and play it on its own without listening the that specific whole album. And if you try selecting the album to pick out and play that specific song it won't work it just plays what it want from that album. And also freezes my attempt to skip the songs till I get to the one I want after 6 tries for one whole hour. I was actually trying to rate it 0 but I see 1 is the lowest,NEGATIVE
"Works in my smart TV, plays good song, everything available. I always buy the premium subscription and I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
"my spotify started freezing and won't open. When I try to log in it pretends to log in and then shows the login screen again and doesn't log back in. It started happening like this last night, I logged out of my account and it stayed that way. I deleted the app, restored or restarted but still the same, please help.",NEGATIVE
I've been paying more for less. Every time I open the app I'm spammed with an ad about some new content from someone I've never shown interest in. Now I'm getting ads for their car thing.,NEGATIVE
Love to stream podcasts and wide variety of music.,POSITIVE
It's cool I hate how persistent the ads can be sometimes but yeaa,POSITIVE
"Same old glitchy BS from the beginning. This service isn't worth the money. Won't play app closes itself. Stop playing randomly, start playing randomly. So all and all not worth it",NEGATIVE
I do love this app. I use it daily.,POSITIVE
"What the hell happened?? I used to love using Spotify but now it keeps pausing randomly in the middle of my songs and podcasts. And there's some kind of weird glitch where when you press play, it'll start playing the song. But you can't pause it, skip to the next song, or even see what song is playing. I don't know what happened but this app is barely usable at this point.",NEGATIVE
Easy to use and fast,POSITIVE
I get my fix whenever I need it. IM ADDICTED! It's a great addiction. Please don't leave me. Sounds like a red flag I know. Thanks Spotify. ðŸ˜ƒ,POSITIVE
Iam unable to open spotify it is always stuck with its symbol and black screen when i open the appðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE

I loveeeee itttttt....but ads just spoil d mood!!,NEGATIVE
Offers very good selection of my favoured music,POSITIVE
Its really good for your mind. Because music is a drug and Hip Hop is my drug dealer....,POSITIVE
Spotify has great music! Still learning how to use it though... I can honestly say that it's better than YouTube.,POSITIVE
The now playing part doesn't show up so I can't compile a playlist,NEGATIVE
"The apps sound quality is very nice and I appreciate it but sometimes the songs stop playing and I have to play it again and again, the ads are the most important part like I know that I don't have a premium pack but it does not mean that there will be ad after every song and not one but two aur three, that's very annoying and irritating. Please fix it ðŸ™",NEGATIVE
The best music library,POSITIVE
"Excellent! Does all it promises, and more.",POSITIVE
The Android wrapper is garbage. Extremely glitchy from time to time even though my updates are turned on. Main issue is that I cannot see what song/podcast is playing (so now I am stuck at 1.5 x speed on Stevie Wonder--a setting I used for listening to podcasts).,NEGATIVE
Best music app on the play store,POSITIVE
Perfect music app ðŸ™â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Best education for all ages. Music has become an essential aspect for all of our lives in the future as well as the past.,POSITIVE
Great App ( can be lagy),NEGATIVE
"Whenever i skip a song, it goes hidden. Why? Just because i didnt want to listen to that song then, or i accidentally skipped it, i cant listen to it? And removing it from hidden is hard too. It doesnt work most of the time. I tapped a hidden song hundreds of times to get it unhiden, but that only worked twice. If i want to make it hidden, give me the option to do so, dont make it mandatory to skip the song. And i cant link to google account. I have just lost everything because of that. 0/10bad",NEGATIVE
App does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy A50! Cannot search for music. App crashes if I attempt to add a song to a Playlist and cannot see Playlist after adding songs on the web. No option appears to play songs either. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times and have logged out and back in several times. I have done everything that I know to reduce background apps running and ensure wifi signal strength. Simply put your app is not compatible with my phone.,NEGATIVE
This good and bad I can't skip only 6 time each days and I don't even have back skips pls delete that pls,NEGATIVE
Great music but after a while the music started cutting out and it had been cutting out every few seconds and if I didn't turn my screen back on it would keep cutting out so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and now nothing loads. I have been using spotify for about 4-5 years now and nothing has happened but now it won't load at all.,NEGATIVE
Fantastic comprehensive range of music,POSITIVE
Amazing plain and simple,POSITIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
This is the best music player I have ever had Spotify has all the song you like you can put them in your liked category and you you have daily mixes that you will enjoy that's why I love using Spotify 5 stars.,POSITIVE
Love the app! But one thing is i dont like the fact that the same ad repeats telling us to get spotify premium. Other then that i HIGHLY reccomend,NEGATIVE
Gives you ads a lot and you get like 10 30 seconds ads in a row,NEGATIVE
"Total fun, easy.",POSITIVE
"Just got started with Spotify, but so far it is very user-friendly and has a great variety artists.",POSITIVE
Wonderful application. No issues so far,POSITIVE
Some of the popular music I listen or I can understand and sing or use for enterprise and faith are in Spotify I do not listen to most music yet because of my culture and religion which writes that music is the opium and doping of non-believing atheists and azazel,NEGATIVE
Everytime I install the app it opens it but it won't go to the log in page it only stays on the Spotify logo and it just stays there I've tried to install and uninstall the app but it doesn't work. And even tryed to restart my phone and check my data and it still doesn't work.,NEGATIVE
I can't believe I pay Â£10 a month for this and you still block the whole screen on startup with ads asking to refer a friend.,NEGATIVE
Very good selection of songs,POSITIVE
Nah you guys are bad I went to play some of my liked songs and it gave me something else songs I don't even know. I just wanna listen to my favorite song.,NEGATIVE
I have a free account but I just got charged $9.99.,NEGATIVE
"The app has been fine for me ever since I downloaded it (probably 2 years ago), but since 2 days ago it hasn't been working for me at all. Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope my app gets fixed :(",NEGATIVE
Best digital music library available,POSITIVE
Spotify rules. It's so dam good!,POSITIVE
App contacts Spotify and shows preferences but doesn't provide Playlist when you click on selected items.,NEGATIVE

If you guys can make it so I can play music from the widget and not having the app run in the background that would be awesome,NEGATIVE
"I cant play the songs i want but instead, its playing other songs. It was ok before but now i cannot play sons i want",NEGATIVE
Enjoy the choices I have with Spotify,POSITIVE
probably the best music app out there but I've just got one tiny problem... i wish we could rearrange songs in our Playlist. we can do that in our queued songs but not in playlists. atleast let us rearrange in the playlist that we've made ourselves.,NEGATIVE
It was fine before update but after the update I can't pick the songs I want to play on the playlist I made to listen to Please fix it!!,NEGATIVE
Good app but still some songs should be there I like BTS still with you song and many more English and Hindi so ðŸ˜¶,POSITIVE
Easy to use and versitile!,NEGATIVE
Best companion for Road trip ðŸ˜ƒ Awesome quality of sound and recommendations of playlists are likewise,POSITIVE
Great! I used to have qq music (the Chinese version of Spotify) and im trilingual plus an opera lover so I miss being able to have translation of foreign languages. Spotify only offers English lyrics for English songs. Translations of lyrics into english. That's the only feature I would suggest.,NEGATIVE
"No adds, loads quickly, and all the music I like!",POSITIVE
Love Spotify listen to it all the time,POSITIVE
"Ui updated now it's like the rows but each row has 1 item in it like , if your gonna make it scroll down instead of across can you at least make the size of the album art fit",NEGATIVE
Great service terrible annoying pestering adds and emails I got four emails in one day about the same promotion. I've unsubscribed from the email but the point is that it's shameless and shouldn't happen. At this point I'd rather go back to YouTube adds than deal with this over the top in your face self promotion. Good job losing a customer spotify.,NEGATIVE
"Can add ""rewind and forward 10 sec"" opt. as I like to hear some specific line in the music and it is difficult to adjust it by that music track line.",NEGATIVE
"Seems to use up a lot of processing, cause audio to cut out when using Bluetooth earbuds. Other music players work fine.",NEGATIVE
Play random song that I don't want like even look for the right song no random song so one star,NEGATIVE
Excellent app I can listen every music in any language,POSITIVE
the app is not opening even after reinstalling for several times. Tried to contact via email no response. All it shows is the logo and nothing else,NEGATIVE
"Someone hacked my account and changed my DOB and now I can't change it back. Also, there aren't random genre Playlist. Only what someone has created.",NEGATIVE
The now playing bar is gone. The app is now useless,NEGATIVE
It's annoying like when ever I'm doing my play list it comes up with random songs that I don't like ðŸ˜ andit evens makes me so frustrated with this app I did it as a 1 star because it doesn't play Ur song it plays something else.,NEGATIVE
Fix your stupid app. It's been crashing for months now,NEGATIVE
Brilliant love the podcasts and the access to music,POSITIVE
"THIS IS A GOOD APP ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES MUSIC !! (man i can't really function well without spotify honestly) The only problem is, why can't I subscribe to a premium plan using smart courier? As a student, that's the only way I can pay for premium. It only says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again."" which happened to me lots of times. The GETPIN method used to work really well but now I can't get a pin. What to do? Or are you able to fix this? :(",NEGATIVE
It's a wonderful app love it ..no problem at all ..and it's really nice coz you have all sorts of different genres of music ðŸŽ¶ to choose from so yeah well done ðŸ‘ Spotify.. great app and I will also recommend it to my family and friends ðŸ’“.cheers mate,POSITIVE
Very helpful if finding new music and genre's and it let's me feel somewhat of a personalized selection when finding music,POSITIVE
"Very annoying app for the Android version. Yes, I am using the free version, but it does not mean I cannot back track a playlist, only giving forward/next track option. Cruel thing you have got. I still prefer the PC version. And if you like get the Windows version spoilt too.",NEGATIVE
Good app I like the way it gives the freedom of choosing your own artists,POSITIVE
Am enjoying this app Spotify l get all the music l want and it's very less on data usage,NEGATIVE
The worst app ever... Was working fine for a few but now I can't even login and i used to use this app for studying but now as i can't even login it's becoming awful.... Spotify please as soon as possible resolve this issue... I like this app. I mean i love it but now i am disappointed... Please solve i want to study happily.... Please please please ðŸ¥º,NEGATIVE
Downloaded the app but it is not opening.,NEGATIVE
Amazing app! And it gets even better when you get the premium!,POSITIVE
"Love it. On demand, can download papists for when offline, Blend playlists with family /friends",POSITIVE
I just facing a issue When we play a playlist when 1st song ends it play something totally different song that song not in a playlist also I am disappointed by this ðŸ˜•,NEGATIVE
"I love this app, it's great, I get to listen to crisp, high quality music. HOWEVER, Spotify mobile is almost straight irritating to use. I understand you guys need to make money, but not letting me even get to pick the song, and only letting me use 6 skips an hour??? Or how about when I make a new playlist for my alarm, I choose several songs I liked, only to wake up to a song I DID NOT put on the playlist? Is that a glitch, or an incredible inconvenience to the user?",NEGATIVE
"Regardless if you use free edition or buy premium, you will ALWAYS get ads. Will upgrade score when Spotify fixes this but I don't see it happening as Ive used Spotify premium for years",NEGATIVE
"I think it's an awesome app, but I would like it if android phone users could see there play list and not snopets of songs",POSITIVE
Perfect place to find music,POSITIVE
"Most recent update is the worst yet. Extreme lag, constantly having to restart the app, and the new Library feature is 10 steps back from the previous UI. Please address these issues or I will no longer be paying for this service.",NEGATIVE
This app is good very nice songs and ad free I love this app very much â¤ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"I would appreciate if you can put the heart to select liked songs, on the lock screen bar. When I drive and find a cool song, it is safer to have it available on my lock screen than to unlock my phone and try and open the app. Deezer has it and would really love you guys to do it, too?!",POSITIVE
We really need a feature to hide censored songs. It might come as a surprise to you but most of the users are adult and will not die of a heartattack if they hear a swear word in a song. However we get annoyed when we hear our favorite songs edited out,NEGATIVE
I love how when you put in a certain artist it gives you a list of songs in the same genre. Really makes it easier to look up songs and hear new ones you've never heard before ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Why the hell can't you play selective music or stop random music being added to playlists that are related to anything never thought I'd say SoundCloud is better,NEGATIVE
"Hi, so when i play any songs and randomly a song pop-up a different song, so i was like WHAT THE HECC IS WRONG WITH SPOTIFY, so yea i gave you a bad review",NEGATIVE
My Spotify is not working for more than 2 weeks . When I am going to any playlist it's say the playlist Is empty and in the liked songs section it's saying something is wrong,NEGATIVE
I've used Spotify for years and it's the best.,POSITIVE
Fabulous love listening to all the oldies,POSITIVE

"Very wide selection, incredible",POSITIVE
Superb quality & fabulous list of songs I'm thankful to your team.,POSITIVE
I want to be able to scroll down my playlist but I can't anymore,NEGATIVE
"Good content, less advertising",POSITIVE
I love this app but the only problem is that ads.I like that they have lyrics in songs. Although it's a good app.,NEGATIVE
Nice app. It would be great if it would be possible to see the music lyrics in the TV when I cast using the Google Chromecast for example.,POSITIVE
"Been using Spotify for a few years now, but I switched to a new phone and now it's not letting me use my account and having me use a new account.",NEGATIVE
The best at this music streaming platform,POSITIVE
"Phone remote to tablet to stereo(s), excellent programming. Excellent entertainment. Spotify is so good you just might quit watching tv...Fantastic playlist generator, and perfect operation with only 2G of freespace. And You, You will have fun-guaranteed-and thats just the free version. Home cache clear.",POSITIVE
Great sound quality!!,POSITIVE
It was terrible and not a pleaseant experinece. The music sucns and couldnt find the crazy frog remix of all time............,NEGATIVE
Don't know why i can't use the app anymore. The screen always stuck at the logo,NEGATIVE
For the past month I've had to either clear the clutter or clear what's been saved or delete and install again more than I can count I love the music on Spotify but every time I'm listening to something and it skips it and the settings aren't off I mean every now and then it just works fine but then after a while it starts skipping again or it starts changing when I'm not ready to change the music I don't know if this is a system error I downloaded every possible update ???????? Thank you,NEGATIVE
It it too good music app during travel time .It shows rarely ads and gives good sound and many more functiona ..I loved it ..I used to enjoy very much this app ...thanks and good luck Spotify team..,POSITIVE
They updated it to where I can't use my favorites playlist or any playlist and to the point where I can't listen to any song I'd like to listen to. I am highly disappointed in this.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is a good app overall but the only problem for me is when I try to change to another song it just loads and plays a short part of the song and then plays another song which I do not like.,NEGATIVE
I love now being alone because my god and Spotify is with me ..,POSITIVE
Wow I love the app It's great I pray it won't change,POSITIVE
"I have very eclectic musical tastes and Spotify connects me to music I love from all genres and eras. It has also been a wonderful way for me to connect musically with my son as we expand each other's musical universe. I find it also has more content in my favorite genres such as old reggae, than the other leading service. I joined Spotify a few years ago and it has improved my life in so many great ways.",POSITIVE
"Honestly I didn't start truly enjoying Spotify until I started using the Student plan for Premium, but it's worth it. Easy listening, easy playlist organization, good quality music.",POSITIVE
I always enjoy the music,POSITIVE
Annoying... can't turn off notifications,POSITIVE
"There is a problem that in notifications, album art of a different song is shown when music is playing.",NEGATIVE
There's some adds but it's usually fine,POSITIVE
Unable to open the app,NEGATIVE
We need a spotify light mode and canvas option for premium users,NEGATIVE
I have paid 7rs for one day just to check the app...it did not activated at all...,NEGATIVE
All and different music..love it!,POSITIVE
The quality is good but song suggestion is worst part of this app,NEGATIVE
LOVE â¤ï¸ my ONLY app for music and podcasts!,POSITIVE
Bro you have to pay to skip songs and you only get six. I think am going to YouTube now spotify is bullshiz,NEGATIVE
"Used to be my go to music app. I used to hold it as the standard. Now the music recommendations suck, the premium features are no longer worth paying for, and the lite version is sub par compared to other music apps out there...so after 7 years, I'm saying sayonara.",NEGATIVE
"It's almost perfect, but there are some things that make me rage, an example is when you play a music/playlist and turn off your phone, the music will keep playing just 2 sometimes and then stop the music instead to keep going. Doesn't matter whatever you do it's always happen, even if you set up to play the music in loop. I think that is just happen to me, although, the rest is perfect.",NEGATIVE
"Something is going wrong. The app want wiring yesterday. It'll start playing songs then stop and not restart. So I closed Theo app and relaunched it and it'd just stop again. So I made sure it was updated, cleared data and cache, then I uninstalled and re-installed and now it will not even open.",NEGATIVE
"A very good app , recommended to all my friends",POSITIVE
Very good all the music you want,POSITIVE
This app is the absolute worst. Why pay for premium and your user cant even access music from the app without it crashing daily or freezing altogether?,NEGATIVE
Songs are streaming but when trying to search song getting no internet connection message,NEGATIVE
Amazing music app,POSITIVE
"Using a Samsung Galaxy A10. App stopped working after a recent software update - all playlists are empty or I get the message ""Oops, something went wrong"". Hope this gets resolved soon.",NEGATIVE
Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.,NEGATIVE
this app is not good because it keeps shuffling songs i just want to hear one song not playlist it should take away the shuffle like if you want it shuffled then do it on your playlist,NEGATIVE
"Not working.. Clear the catch, clean data.. Everything ll be try to open.... Nw what can do, iz working probably...???",NEGATIVE
"Spotify was my fav app till the updated it now it sucks i hate the new update you just can't turn off the shuffle button it's not even showing it now and it makes me soo mad all i want to say is,You have ruined spotify and everyone's saying the same thing you better fix this issue",NEGATIVE
"Its good, i don't get ads without purchasing the subscription . I've used it for like 5 months its working perfectly. I find all the songs that i want from acroos the world. Keep up the good work :)",POSITIVE
"Love it , though would love more old stuff too",POSITIVE
Outstanding music streaming. Even obscure music can be found. Rarely issues and when they occur they are fixed quickly.,NEGATIVE
Smooth experience only challenge is not able to identify original or remix,NEGATIVE
"Buggy mess. Don't use if you want to listen to podcasts. No player until you open the app back up and a lot of the time it's missing. I have to close the app and reopen just to find the pause button. Also it's way too sensitive and often accidentally skip the episode by the slightest ""swipe"" and often shows finished when I go back which is infuriating when the podcast is hours long. BRING US A PLAYER!",NEGATIVE
So good but only if u have spotify primuim,POSITIVE
Because I could not listen to the songs that I saved,NEGATIVE
Very Op songs and very good,POSITIVE
It is a really good streaming service to listen to any song that you can for free. But the function to filter the liked playlist isn't working. I don't know why as this is a useful feature. I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else though. But other than that it is possibly the best music streaming service there is.,POSITIVE
Please come up with light mode feature ðŸ±,NEGATIVE
Because of I listen all bts song in Spotify,POSITIVE
"In the latest update they adopted pandora's 'you must have premium to have a nonshuffled playlist' and everything is now a radio station making playlists redundant unless you're premium. Honestly I'd rather use youtube, soundcloud, or my old tablet that can still play nonshuffled songs. Or the spotify web player cause it's only mobile that's suffering this Also too many ads not enough ad breaks. And they can string 15 ads together, crash the device, and make you listen to 5 more.",NEGATIVE
"Started as an almost 5/5 app. But then product managers started to ""improve"" the product and with each upgrade the product is less usable for me. It's more about what they want you to listen to instead of what you want to listen to. Offline songs get deleted on a regular basis so you have to re-download them again and again. Last time I learned that on an airplane...",NEGATIVE
The app is good but at times it stops playing all of a sudden,NEGATIVE
Amazing experience just perfer yt music better,POSITIVE
"It is a good app, with most songs I have looked for are available, but recently my liked songs are not showing when I log into Spotify on my laptop, and I have restarted the app, and reinstalled it several times, but I still can't see my liked songs, so not sure why this is happening ðŸ˜¢",NEGATIVE
Sound quality is perfect but too many ads without premium subscription which is disgusting. That's it.,NEGATIVE
"I listen to music many hours every day. Spotify has such a great variety of music. I love their custom daily playlists. I find music I find music I haven't heard in years in them, fantastic.",POSITIVE
Super music player i enjoy it,POSITIVE
"Very nice, BTW check out my epic Playlist ""nice songs""",POSITIVE
Easy to use and great selections,POSITIVE
My app is not opening ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,NEGATIVE
"After the update I cannot play the music I want it just keep playing the song that are suggested and not on my playlist,please remove this feature it ruins the whole app.",NEGATIVE
"Was awesome until I opened it today and couldn't have songs play on laps, not bring able to play songs by themselves. And more..",POSITIVE
1year yusing dis app dis in nice song,NEGATIVE
"I remember when I first started with spotify it's use to be good, then the price went up and my playlists went down simple mean other things will follow, I will watch and see",NEGATIVE
I've had Spotify premium since 2017 and it's never failed to provide the right tunes when nessecary. Never need wifi to play a song. Spotify is the BEST!!!,POSITIVE
"DO NOT USE SPOTIFY if you intend to store music offline to an external storage card. There is a massive issue with the app not recognizing the card after a restart and trying to re-download all your offline music to internal storage creating multiple locations in the process. It's only been an issue for about 7 years so the developers clearly haven't got a clue how to resolve it, they just palm to off with the usual reinstall advice WHICH DOESN'T WORK.",NEGATIVE
"Worst app I pay for. I have to delete it and re-install at least 3 to 4 times a week. It either stops playing after 10 minutes or won't stop playing. I have to open the phone and close the app. Then it starts playing when I get back in the car and won't stop when I get out of the car. I have to open the phone, open the app and delete the app.",NEGATIVE
"And again - Nothing has changed! Original postðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸- The App now: Stops every 10 minutes. Carrys on playing & cannot be shut down. Does not upload. Yes, I've uninstalled. The latest update is poor, I have no idea how the UX or QA cycle ever got signed off. Downloaded content will not play when you move onto another episode. Cuts out. UI looks crowded and not smooth at all. Paying premium for a product that does not work properly. Acknowledge & own the faults Spotify, then fix! Thanks",NEGATIVE
It's a very good app! It doesn't shows ads very often..i can skip or play many songs and then the ad may play but not always.,POSITIVE
Never ending music pleasure,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is an audio content access platform. Mostly, that works well. However, there seem to always be issues with the basics while new features get rolled out that are really not necessary, and sometimes even unclear. For example, on a flaky network connection, I cannot access my downloaded/offline content. That obviously defeats the purpose. Another one was that, on a flaky network, a podcast kept pausing and resuming a half-second, contentwise, later. @Spotify Please focus on solid basics!!!",NEGATIVE
At first it was grt but now It's not at all working like before. I select a song but it plays another,NEGATIVE
"You basically can't use it without premium at all. Also bugs and It shows I'm offline despite playing music from my own playlists just fine, but I can't search for music. Unusable mess pushing weird stuff on me when it does see the Internet connection. Unless you pay and build your own playlists, knowing exactly what you want to listen to yourself I'd never recommend. It's for people that love music itd for average person what doesn't know what to listen to and can get manipulated by algorithm",NEGATIVE
Spotify is really good And with it lyrics when playing music,POSITIVE
Man Spotify's the ðŸ. Great to know that it has put COVID warning in the appropriate episodes of Joe Rogan Podcast. ( ÍÂ° ÍœÊ–Í¡Â°)á•¤,POSITIVE
User friendly and recomends great personalised mixes. I do feel that there should be an option to donate to musicians on free music platforms,POSITIVE
Amazing bro but lessen the adds to like every ten songs instead of twoðŸ’€,POSITIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
Great music any music u like to hear,POSITIVE
Ads are disturbing,NEGATIVE
"It's amazing to be able to find and listen to songs you haven't heard in ages and the recommendations lead you to bands you forgot about ! Thanks ðŸ˜Š. Update 7-21-22 it's still worth the payment. I've favored many songs from their suggestions, you asked me to rate again and I see why. You're awesome Spotify !",POSITIVE
Great app but Spotify can't play some song and please add song in Spotify some song are not in Spotify,NEGATIVE
No change to my Spotify app. Funny how it doesn't work for me on my Android yet my wife and sons have no problems with their phones? Maybe it is because I openly criticize the Bozo some people elected to be president and the fact police are bold as ever? Spotify I'll be closing you out and you will get no more money from me. Let's Go Brandon !,NEGATIVE
Good music but I can't stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road :(( didn't have that the past couple years,NEGATIVE
This app is great as it makes play lists depending on what you've listened to before and generally puts together a good list for you to listen to.,POSITIVE
I love the playlists and the wide variety of songs and podcasts,POSITIVE
Outstanding application..this app can cunsume a little data. It has an advertise in m7CH quantity..,POSITIVE
If I can't change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,NEGATIVE
You can find any track you want brilliant app.,POSITIVE
Trash login system. ... Whenever i try logging into some other device through my mobile number...the OTP never arrives. ðŸ˜  . . . STOP BEGGING FOR PREMIUM.,NEGATIVE
My only and favorite app for music. I pay for premium to skip all the commercials but enjoy the fact you can follow friends playlists and make multiple playlists of your own in the library. Best music app thus far. ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
"The best online Music app ever !! The quality of music, collection of songs, non-premium service quality & value-for-money premium plans... There's no match to Spotify !! Note: This review after 1 year of non-premium usage, 1 month of premium usage of Spotify & using umpteen number of other premium & non-premium online Music apps including prime music for the last 1 year.",NEGATIVE
I just love Spotifyyyyyyy!!!!,POSITIVE
I do not recommend this. It keeps playing extra songs and not the ones I want. I hate this,POSITIVE
Well i dont have a prob is that when i try to listen to music it gives me 1 or 2 ads and then says i have 30min of no ad but only last 10min and also now it gives me 8 or 9 ads,NEGATIVE
Very Good Music Quality ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
why do you keep updating it ffs your making it worse! if it aint broke dont fix it whoever makes the updates for this sack them on the spot hes a retard.,NEGATIVE
"The best, deleted other streaming app when I found out about Spotify. So perfect",POSITIVE
Just the best app to listen to music.,POSITIVE
"Spotify is great I love it, mainly because I listen to music 24/7 but my main problem with the app is the fact that it barely ever plays the songs on my Playlist, it just play suggested songs before it even thinks about the songs that I actually want to listen to. This even happens when I play my liked songs.",NEGATIVE
"The experience is out of thi world,just wonderful !",POSITIVE
Fabulous and entertaining really appreciated. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Very good play list,POSITIVE
A good music streaming app,POSITIVE
"I like Spotify even more now that there's lyrics to the songs. I also like Spotify because I can leave the app, do other things on my phone and still be able to listen to the music.",POSITIVE
Brilliant ap - have the paid for version. The free one is difficult to use as the songs don't play in order. But the paid for ap is fantastic.,POSITIVE
Easy app to use and enjoy,POSITIVE
"Recently spotify hasn't been letting me listen to songs and says that all playlists that I click on are empty (even random ones) whenever I click on my library it's empty even tho I know I havent deleted any of my playlists, whenever I go to my own profile they are all there though and it's getting really annoying since this is a streaming app that I love",NEGATIVE
when karaoke feature available?,POSITIVE
Fine app if you want to pay for the service and I try to listen without premium service and you got to go through 10 ads before playing and you can only listen to your list as they play it and if you skip you only get 6 skips per hour to listen to your own song list. Wasn't this way when I started this app about a month ago... It's a shame,NEGATIVE
Exceptional.. 4 stars just coz of the annoying ads in free version,NEGATIVE
"I am ""guaranteed 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" after listening to 4 advertisements. Two (3 minute) songs later, I get two more advertisements. At least be honest and just tell me that I'm going to get ads every couple of songs.",NEGATIVE
Spotify you need to fix your app ok? I was literally listening to in the middle of the night and boom it plays a random song so plss Spotify bring back the repeat ft because I love this app and it can be improved but I think your just doing this so more people purchase premium.this is a money grab I can just purchase premium but I have more thing to deal with so pls Spotify bring back the repeat ft,NEGATIVE
Great App. All Songs available at a single click.Amazing.,POSITIVE
Lot's of ad's,NEGATIVE
Best music app on the planet,POSITIVE
Toooo many ads,NEGATIVE
"The best music app EVER, I got everything I need in just one app",POSITIVE
I love Spotify but it's always makes difficult to listen and I really hate that and there's always bags,NEGATIVE
"Got a free 2 month premium trial from a friend and started getting ads after one month. Also, sound quality is inferior to Pandora.",NEGATIVE
"After every song I would get about 3-4 ads. Features are very limited, limited skips, shuffle only overall a really bad app. I would reccomend only using the desktop version but ads are really incessant there too.",NEGATIVE
It's much better than ganna app. J m really enjoying it,POSITIVE
"Great app the ads are not bad at all,I love it ðŸ¥ºâ¤ï¸ðŸ¤žso boring that you have to pay before you can download any songs ðŸ’”ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜­",NEGATIVE
I love the content....but this app continually crashes. The podcast keeps playing but there is no way to stop it without closing the app completely. Been this way for months.,NEGATIVE
"This may be a good app until I wanted to play a song, a specific one to say. But it always shows a ""suggested"" song that I dont want and I cant even stand it anymore so please fix this cause all we want is some music.",NEGATIVE
I can renew my payment on this app with my Nigeria card and it annoying ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"Can't even choose a song. If you select a specific song, the app will choose some other song for you.",NEGATIVE
The mobile version of Spotify is currently unusable on my device. There isn't a way to play individual songs from a playlist or an album. The only upside is that podcasts work as expected.,NEGATIVE
Doctor who and soundtracks mostly also I hop it free so far,POSITIVE
when it says free premium for a month it should mean free premium for a month not sign up for spotify premium that doesnt make sense and u shouldn't have to wait for skips and u need to remove songs we added i hate the songs you added,NEGATIVE
Downloading a playlist only means you'll have the first 10 seconds of each song. Embarrassing. I switched to this after Google got rid of Google music. I guess nothing good exists anymore.,NEGATIVE
Best music/podcast app ever,POSITIVE
Damn i hate spotify!! When i want to click my favourite it turns out a different song!!! UGH I GONNA UNINSTALL THIS APP SERIOUSLY MAKE ME ANGRYðŸ˜¡ðŸ™„,NEGATIVE

"According to me this app is good but after a year of using it i find a problem of using it ,as it always says that I'm offline even when I'm online.",NEGATIVE
"Occasional bugs here and there. Sometimes they fix them, sometimes they don't. At least not right away. Also bummed that, and I understand for legal reasons, there are some bands/albums/musicians that are not available.",NEGATIVE
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment.",NEGATIVE
please stop addding song that are not in my playlist. Its so annoying to listen to a song not on your playlist when you want to listen to YOUR playlist not what Spotify wants. I wish there was a option i tried everything and Nothing worked so PLEASE make it an option!,NEGATIVE

Not sure how spotify manages to be a 7 billion dollar company and also an app that literally doesn't work half the time but I can't find an app like it so here we are,NEGATIVE
"No ads, just music",NEGATIVE
Best music player ever,POSITIVE
"Overall, I pay the $10 a month because I appreciate what the app provides. However, for $10 a month, it's a little irritating that the offline mode sometimes acts up and even though things are downloaded, the app can't access them.",NEGATIVE
i cannot live without Spotify.,POSITIVE

Too much ads now a days. So uninstalling the app.,NEGATIVE

Good app for listening music but one problem creates that is sometimes you chose another music to listen in between ads are disturbing to you ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”.....,NEGATIVE
Unexplainable. I'm extremely happy eith Spotify ever since i been introduced to it last year by a friend. I'm rating 5 ðŸŒŸ's,POSITIVE
Really like having limited ad's and they don't take up the whole screen.,NEGATIVE
Good just long ads and to much ads I'll skip probably 1 so ng and I'll get about 3 to 4 ads,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify just Awesome â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Worst app i have ever used. When you try to login it shows that it has an issue try later and not even twice or thrice but always. Please Spotify either look after this or you will have trouble later.,NEGATIVE
"I like it and although many people are complaining it works just fine the playlist will be ""blocked"" sometimes on some devices because of updates but if you make sure it is updated it is fine.",POSITIVE
Really good app for music lovers,POSITIVE
Amazing app with premium,POSITIVE
Wide array of beautiful music. Thank you,POSITIVE
Solid. Very enjoyable.,POSITIVE

Very nice music application,POSITIVE
I find my old tunes on Google and your right there to add awsome,NEGATIVE
I love it I find all my fave music n new songs that come out I like that if u buy subscription u don't have any commercial,POSITIVE

The user experience is amazing.,POSITIVE
I love having the music of the world under my fingers.,POSITIVE
Great app tons of music,POSITIVE
Great app. Good connectivity,POSITIVE
"Perfect -- extremely well designed, seamless across all my devices, fast/responsive, simple interface. Kudos to the development team and UI designers.",POSITIVE
I've changed my mind and they have improved this app.,POSITIVE
Excellent app. Very rarely is a song choice not available.,NEGATIVE
Wish I could arrainge order of favorite songs on playlist,NEGATIVE
"As always great app, what would we do without Spotify.",POSITIVE
I give this app a 1 because there is a problem i always click on a song and put another it is so bad,NEGATIVE
I enjoyed this app the first week I listened the songs on it,POSITIVE
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all.",POSITIVE
The Thunderstorm Podcast is what it is because of Spotify!! Anchor you're awesome!!!!,POSITIVE
Deleted. Started auto playing weird stuff. Turned off all auto play buttons but clearly not enough. There are better apps,NEGATIVE
Super and nice songs to enjoy music,POSITIVE
Paid for the premium and enjoy the ease of use with no ads. Would give it 5 stars if the free version didn't have so many ads and you could select the song you want on your playlist rather than having to listen to it on random.,POSITIVE
"Not only does Spotify glitch, it also shuts down all apps ðŸ˜ even if I'm only running one app ðŸ˜ now I have to cancel my subscription because I can't use it as it's only connected to Spotify. But wait, I tried Spotify Lite so that I didn't waste my subscription.. same thing, just worse. Not even latest version works. More Bug Fixes Needed -Don't subscribe- How come there are ads in the podcast episodes when I've bought premium to avoid ads? Doesn't make much sense.",NEGATIVE
"the ""we added"" feature thing is useless every single time you make a playlist with one song they just add more so you get less ""bored"" or stuff idk bruh this app is good but I wouldn't recommend making your own playlist",NEGATIVE
This app has great sound quality and easy to use,POSITIVE
When I entered my Spotify my account all missed up and no longer showing or allowing me to access the Playlists I made or any artists and my favorite music's. Poor service ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
It's definitely a good but a little problem it's has only a little skips even thought you have premium and when i make my playlist the song is short,NEGATIVE
It's pretty good but when your a free listener u get limited skips and u can't stay in the same Playlist like for example if I'm listing to boy with uke three songs later I get a whole new different song so can u please fix this?,NEGATIVE
"So many ad disturbances kindly without premium, suggestion take the all problem seriously..thanks..",POSITIVE
Kept pausing for no reason so i tried to uninstall and then reinstall. Now the app won't open past the spotify logo. I have been a premium subscriber for years but now if this doesn't start working soon I'll have to try a different service. Very disappointing.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is so cool,POSITIVE
This is the best app to listen to music and release you stress â¤ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’š I would use this app 24/7ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
Such a best music experience but there are lots of ads,NEGATIVE
I'm changing my review frome 5âœ¨ to 3âœ¨ just because they removed eisenfunks song called PONG,NEGATIVE
I love that I can make my own playlists and I also enjoy those created for me. Have found some new bands!,POSITIVE
As a consumer an a artist Spotify been good with innovation on algorithms. Pay could be better but they put my song in front of different audiences who now follow everywhere,POSITIVE
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends",NEGATIVE
I like spotify it is good . Pls put new songs on it .,POSITIVE
I love that app but there is stuff like stupid stuff that you need vip and I don't want to pay to do this little things,NEGATIVE
"Great price for a great service. Love, love, love",POSITIVE
Good song picks but hope the sound quality will be at par with Tidal in the future nevertheless sound quality is good. It also lacks EQ to make songs a bit of your personal tuning.,NEGATIVE
Good selection of music and artist,POSITIVE
Best music experience!!!,POSITIVE
Love it . There when I'm In need of a familiar sound to match my mood,POSITIVE
That's so cool kinda app but its little bit weird â¤,NEGATIVE
Awesome I love the music sound,POSITIVE
"Really good app, have had it for 5 years and has always been great. I listen to everything, sometimes Lags a bit but I think it's just down to the amount of tunes I have",NEGATIVE
"I get to hear two songs, and then get 3 ads in a row, then I might be able to listen to 5 songs, but then get 4 ads in a row. When I first started using this app, I thought it was okay, but now all I seem to hear are ads, and suggested songs that I didn't add to any of my playlists. And why are they trying to get me to listen to country? I'm not a fan of that genre, but when I click the minus botton it plays 3 ads in a row. I know I'm one person, but this is really frustrating.",NEGATIVE
"If I pay for an ad free experience, I expect my content to be ad free. Spotify double-dipping and forcing me to listen to ads on podcasts, even though I pay for a premium subscription, is a disappointing display of unnecessary greed. That coupled with the fact that downloadable, offline listening is a promised feature that almost NEVER works makes me wonder why I have a subscription in the first place.",NEGATIVE
I can't open spotify. I've reinstalled a lot of time already and nothing.,NEGATIVE
It keeps crashing n turning off.,NEGATIVE
I am using Spotify premium and Podcasts are not working anymore. Big downgrade. Do sth about it and soon.,NEGATIVE
"I had this for 4 years, and the newest update? I can't work it i logged in, everything is ""empty"" and stuff like that. Like??? Please fix it?????",NEGATIVE
"Really irritating that everytime I select one of my playlist it just loads forever or shows a blank screen, forcing me to restart the app.",NEGATIVE
Good audio quality but will sometimes not load downloaded playlists/songs and will only open downloads when data is turned off on my end,NEGATIVE
This app is a better then any other music app.ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,NEGATIVE
Cannot fault Spotify. ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
It is a great overall experience with Spotify,POSITIVE
It's ok as an app to listen to music but the update made me review 4 stars,POSITIVE
This new update sucks. I wish the app was displayed on the notification bar so I could just scroll down and change or pause. It's a hassle to stop 1 app and go into Spotify then go back to original app. It should appear on lock screen as well.,NEGATIVE
I need help!!! My spotify NOT OPEN!!!! PLEASE.,NEGATIVE
Refuses to work on my phone works fine on other devices have tried all steps to get it to work with zero success not good enough for something I pay for.,NEGATIVE
"So much to receive with this app. Brings back so many memories ""even If I forgotten all about it the song remembers when""",POSITIVE
new update is hot trash. select library and it puts you immediately into your playlists. what happens if i don't use playlists? now you just added an extra step for no purpose. artists are now randomly listed. no alphabetical order. no rhyme or reason. I've downloaded these songs dozens of times and everytime they do another ill conceived update all songs are deleted yet again. albums are a disaster. no organization.,NEGATIVE
Love all the music.... uninterrupted,POSITIVE
"One word describes spotify, AWESOME!",POSITIVE
"It's amazing, just bummer that you can't get songs that are only found on YouTube on Spotify but otherwise I like this app a lot",POSITIVE
"UI glitches sometimes. The screen will get stuck and show the same thing even when I switch the song. Also app totally crashed when trying to move from internal to external storage, so I had to reinstall it",NEGATIVE
Listening to my favorite artists and letting me branch out to find music everyday is the best experience. Always something new and I'm here for it,POSITIVE
Almost no problems unlike YouTube music,POSITIVE
"Overall a good app for music! I give it 4 stars only because it glitches more than usual since I've actually downloaded the app, but I could give it a 5 star rating!",POSITIVE
"Spotify rocks. I use premium and it's elite, love it more than Pandora for sure. Spotify makes it easy to listen to what you love and helps you explore! My music has expanded a lot thanks to Spotify. 10/10 would recommend.",POSITIVE
Really good selection of music,POSITIVE
I was having a great experience but near a year ago the app shut down so I had to reinstall it . I couldn't login into my ID even though every information was correct . I had to make new account and soon as I made it I was logged off . Now I'm using the Chrome version of it. Hoping the bugs can be fixed!,NEGATIVE
Getting a bit glitchy not letting me skip the songs as a tab I have to go on to the app then it doesn't show me what song I'm listening 2 either,NEGATIVE
Music access is fine but app is extremely buggy and often crashes,NEGATIVE
And everytime i listen to the song it plays then it stops,NEGATIVE
Switched from Live X a year and half ago and also had Apple Music. Spotify is the best.,POSITIVE
Hey my music don't play right it doesn't play it doesn't pause but when it does the bar at the bottom doesn't show and the bar on my notifications doesn't disappear and another bar on my notification keeps saying Spotify connections ??!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
I already disliked this app on mobile anyway but the experience i am having is souring my thoughts on it more. On console and desktop its awsone! But on mobile you really would use this. I repeatedly try to skip songs i already have hidden on the first place so they shouldnt play anway but they still do. And even if i hide a song i dont like it still plays which annoys me. You are better off using some other app than this on mobile. 0/10 if i could give it that rating.,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming app you can find!,POSITIVE
"Spotify is my music source. With premium being so affordable, I don't have to listen to any other music platform, cause Spotify does everything possible. You can't find a reason not to put good vibes out there for their music platform. Get all your music needs from Spotify, they understand music. Good Job Spotify.",POSITIVE
It's all good and amazing and all but why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is that I wish this app could switch accounts like yea so u could just change the acc like if there are 3 ppl and yea they don't have another device so i wish u could've just make accounts switch so yea I wish u could do that and yea otherwise 5/5 but pls make this happen ðŸ˜‰,NEGATIVE
The app is great but now it is hard to find the song that I listen to more over all I love it I would have given it a 10/5,POSITIVE
Cant control phone volume from GW4. Have to come out of Spotify and then load up media controller to control phone volume,NEGATIVE
"The amount you pay for premium is ridiculous, given that you have access to almost every song you want to find and that you can even download it to listen to it while offline.",NEGATIVE
It says no internet connection available even though I am connected . Maybe there is no connection for another entity to manipulate the data packets that the manipulated music is attempting to inject. Just like the rest of the world. I wonder if you are liable for damages to people thought process,NEGATIVE
Spotify is very good,POSITIVE
"It's nice because even if I don't have the paid for service I can still have music without it open on my screen unlike YouTube which not only wants me to keep my screen on but frequently pesters me if I'm still watching it. Which is very inconvenient for use while doing anything else at the same time, especially if I'm trying to wash dishes...",NEGATIVE
Got pretty much all want in music not without exception though. Still the best there is in my opinion by a long shot.,POSITIVE
After new update... Only loading screen no song nothing,NEGATIVE
Very annoying that every time I go to click my playlist it just freezes. It's good other then that,NEGATIVE
Throughout the years more and more things are taken away from free Spotify and made premium only. What a greedy app.,NEGATIVE
I can't use anymore my acct prem from abroad..what's happening to you Spotify ..kaloka kaðŸ˜,NEGATIVE
Works do hood and plays my favorite music,POSITIVE
Lots of good sounds for free!,POSITIVE
I cannot listen to music...whatever I want to listen to says playlist empty.,NEGATIVE
More ads than Hulu and YouTube combined. Going back to the pirates. â˜ ï¸,NEGATIVE
It's just music. Who doesn't like music?,NEGATIVE
Music cuts off here and there. This is from a premium subscriber,NEGATIVE
Like the music but it is a pain that spotify auto connects every time I get in the car or on the bike. Even if I was listening to a podcast or some other music streaming service. Probably delete it before the week is out unless I find out how to stop it.,NEGATIVE
"Worst place to listen to podcasts. Do not expect to pick up where you left off cause Spotify can't even get there timestamp right. Very glitchy all of the time and never works the same way twice, GOOD LUCK",NEGATIVE
Stop adding suggested songs I hate it all I want is to listen to a rickroll AND I CANT I HAVE TO LISTEN TO STUPID SONGS fix this OR IM DELETING SPOTIFY FOREVER,NEGATIVE
Easy to find what music you like.,POSITIVE
Soooo many ads...... quick tip: quit your app when an ad plays and reopen it to no ad. Works well,NEGATIVE
This the most trashiest music app I've ever download dont but anything from this app its useless,NEGATIVE
"Perfect , i want student premium but i can't find my college",NEGATIVE
"Somebody connected to my account with a different email and I had no access to my playlists or account and no help from spotify to rectify the problem, deleted the app...",NEGATIVE
would be neat if this app could show lyrics. and hate tha I've gotta save the whole album when I'm in fact only need one song,NEGATIVE
"Im getting really tired of it getting glitched out on me and constantly having to Uninstall and reinstall it especially when I pay for premium every month. Like come on. Do better. and NOW it's not even loading. it won't let me in. I unstalled and installed twice and still, nothing.",NEGATIVE
"better than Apple music, but it's a bit annoying that it gets you used to premium for the starting month, and then you're stuck with shuffle mode forever unless you purchase premium. other than that 10/10 edit: bro stop giving me three ads! im so done! and two of the ads are back to back the same thing. taking a star back",NEGATIVE
Too many ads and some covers are not there,NEGATIVE
Private sessions option should be permanent or has permanent private session option. And option to hide or remove recommend playlist.,NEGATIVE
You should add a thing where if you like the playlist it likes all the songs for and you should make it give you premium for 1 year and then after that year it removes you from premium. Overall it is amazing.,POSITIVE
When I got to play a song it brings me to a playlist and I can't just enjoy song that I want to listen to it's annoying that they add random songs to my playlist and I can't skip them,NEGATIVE
Unable to download music and yes I do have a premium account.,NEGATIVE
Fantastic to have all that music to choose from,POSITIVE
"Really glad I found this, since finding it I have gotten rid of all my other music apps.",POSITIVE
Works fine but gets glitchy sometimes,NEGATIVE
"I can't add songs from one playlist to another, the app kicks me out sometimes. I have premium.",NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify! I have acsess to all my favorite music 24/7 365. Theres only been one song that they didnt have. I have a huge genre. Like i tell my children, me and Spot be hanging out everyday, everywhere and any time!!â¤",POSITIVE
Best music app with social sharing features,POSITIVE
"Great to stream just what I want, whenever I want",POSITIVE
This Stinks! I hate it!!! why even Make a Premium?!! why can't we just enjoy it for Free like the other music Things!! it's Stupid as Flip :/,NEGATIVE
"If I'm listening to a podcast, after playing one episode it will stop and won't load anything. It's no just paused it's just like the whole thing breaks. They always play 'suggested songs' even if I have a playlist with a ton of songs already there. Also, when I pause it, I come back and its playing again.",NEGATIVE
After new update its only 6 shuffle,NEGATIVE
"its great ! a good music app, but the problem is, it has wayy TOO MUCH adds. its really annoying. i also cannot skip to the songs u want to hear, and limited 6 skips an hour. i can only preview songs too. also, sometimes when i'm listening to one of my playlists, random songs pop up, and they aren't even in my playlist. and aren't my type of music.",NEGATIVE
"Great app,if possible please add sleep timer .",POSITIVE
Alway find the Music I want to Listen to!!!,POSITIVE

"It won't work anymore everything I click on it says it's empty, and I've deleted it and reinstalled it, and idk whatelse to do.",NEGATIVE
"This app has so many insperation.it helps me calm down,relax. I love this app sosososososososososososososo much it is amazing â¤ï¸â€ðŸ©¹âœ¨",POSITIVE
I would have rated it 5stars but sometimes there are some problems,NEGATIVE
Like this new update sucks! Old SPOTIFY was better! Just give up your dreams I want to play my song,NEGATIVE
"just one problem. i like using my SD card for downloaded songs. everytime i get a phone update or fully turn my phone off, all my downoaded songs move to my phone's internal storage. i want it to stay in my SD card becauss transferring the data takes forever. please do something about this!",NEGATIVE
"Used to be a good app. Now it will pick Playlists I don't even listen to, nor have I ever listened to them. With the free version you will listen to 3 ads before maybe two songs if you're lucky. Going back to Pandora or just sticking with YouTube.",NEGATIVE
"It keeps saying ""You're offline"" when my internet connection says excellent",POSITIVE
Overall great music i would definitely say this is the best music app.,POSITIVE
Top one music ..but mention downloading option.,POSITIVE
"I'm annoyed. I have used Spotify for a while, and it was great up untill maybe a couple weeks ago, because I think I remember updating, and now every two song there are like three ads. I didn't download this app to listen to non stop adverts, I downloaded it to listen to music. I hope the developers can make it so that there are less ads. thanks!",NEGATIVE
All types of songs are available here and no stopper and all. Love it.,POSITIVE
songs are hidden but only in certain playlists and not in others?? I can't unhide them? what is going on. im a premium member and I know that shouldn't be an issue. updated and reinstalled and still not working,NEGATIVE

I love spotify's premium version but these days I can't seem to gat premium I hope you could fix the prepaid option for premium because its having a lot of errors. I am really disappointed and annoyed by it.,NEGATIVE
The app is amazing no ads and can hear all the music i like,POSITIVE
"It always plays the same songs, and making playlists is extremely tedious. If you want to add more than one song by the same artist you have to search for them over and over again after each song added.",NEGATIVE
"So great indeed, every sort of music is available",POSITIVE
This is the best app for music ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰,POSITIVE

Thanks for this app we can slecet artist in Spotify and very good quality of sound Thanks,POSITIVE
"I'm okay with the add for 30s, but FOUR TIMES in a row is just to much. But have wide range of songs to select so it's fine I guess?",POSITIVE
This app is so annoying I make my Playlist and then it just adds random songs and I can't even delete them I deleted the app and going to find a new one,NEGATIVE
"Previous update is worst! Songs are like music in a pirated cd that has glitched or ""jumping""! And now even in premium i cannot download songs after uninstalling and installing the apps. Like im paying for nothing. ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„",NEGATIVE
Always opens when connected to Bluetooth via vehicle. O select option not to auto start...still auto start. Would give 5 stars but this kills it for me.,NEGATIVE
The app is good so far but I need to make use of it very well.,POSITIVE
Worst app ever I can't even sign into this app!! It tells me again and again that the combination of my email and password is incorrect !! Worst app!!ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Using this app since a year now but nowadays the quantity of advertisments are so maore means first I used to recommend people that they can use this app as the music quality is also great and not so much ads but now the ads are uncountable means after every 2 songs they will keep ads they are giving pressure to purchase premium.,NEGATIVE
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great.",NEGATIVE
ALWAYS has great selection of Music to choose from.,POSITIVE
How to enable sing feature on Spotify?,POSITIVE
Great for road trips and working! I enjoy making my own playlists as well as listening to the suggestions that Spotify comes up with based on my previous plays. The family membership helps cut costs as well. I can share music with my husband and vice versa!,POSITIVE
Why does this application always stop suddenly? I was enjoying the song and it kept stopping? Please fix this issue. Thank you.,POSITIVE
"Great music that you can't find on Pandora. Music is clear and good quality for the speakers I am listening through, whether it be my car or headphones, great quality.",POSITIVE
Wonderfully easy app to use which has huge flexibility and amazing features many of which I have not used properly yet. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have audio playing as part of their life.,POSITIVE
"Used to be my go-to app but since this last update it won't let me transfer my files to my data to my SD card, my data connection is NOT very good so I download my most listened to music for offline hence the SD card but now it doesn't work so 1 star... You will belucky if this app remains on my phone",NEGATIVE
I love how many songs it has and how you can make playlist but I hate how many ads there are I skipped one song and got 6 ads,NEGATIVE
Love group listen and shared playlists,POSITIVE
Easy to compile playlist,NEGATIVE
Makes work more enjoyable! â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
"Absolutely perfect,the best music app to use,its fast and effective.i gave it five star beacuse i love it.keep up the good work.",POSITIVE
"Spotify is currently playing suggested songs and nothing actually on my playlists and won't give me my six free skips. It's very irritating. I love this app but not when it does this, please fix.",NEGATIVE
"app is and always was amazing,, even going 3 years back, this is still my 'one of choice'. however recently i downloaded it for mobile and soon found out that after a certain amount of time, you can't play any song from a certain folder you made that you wish to play ; instead having to just play it on shuffle,, annoyingly enough.",NEGATIVE
"Virtually any song at my fingertips, podcasts from my favorite creators, and I can take them to have with needing internet to stream! â™¡",NEGATIVE
"The app is extremely buggy now a days. I love the service, the app is garbage",NEGATIVE
Not a good experience at all . I would like to know why my card is billed from this service? Because I never joined this service ever .. I sent an email to cancel after this payment came out on my card .. to find out how and what Is happening and no response.,NEGATIVE
"Why is it when we choose a song this other random song plays!? I hate the ""update"" pls change it",NEGATIVE
Idk wt to say but tooo Gud to be true but I gave 4 stars by of tooooooooooo many adds,POSITIVE
I will give this a one star cause the new update of this apps is like making me angry everytime I play my favorite song it will change now I will give this 1 star,NEGATIVE
Music lovers biggest fan. Spotify doesn't mess around when it comes to music.,POSITIVE
They add songs to my playlists and I can't even find them on the playlists anymore so I'm stuck listening to songs I hate and I can't skip them because not only do I have a limited amount of skips but it'll also skip to more songs I can't find on the playlists so I can't edit them out.,NEGATIVE
The ads are too much. I have to listen to atleast 1:30 minutes of ads and it kind of annoying. Please do something about it,NEGATIVE
"Fabulous. Bye bye CD, LP & cassette collection of 1,000+ albums, hello unlimited music ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜",POSITIVE
It is a very nice app and I even saw versions of songs I didn't knew were there example tik tok,POSITIVE
"It keeps popping ""Your offline"" even tho my internet access is strong",POSITIVE
"So far, so good! If Spotify would be open for suggestions, consider partnership with a strong online startup specializing in providing ACCURATE instrumental score to the songs WE, your customers, listen to. (I'm sure a creative mind would see this and take it to the team.)",POSITIVE
Easy to navigate. Not too many ads.,POSITIVE
"So much music, not enough time",NEGATIVE
My always go to app ... Loved every feature of it... Only thing I hate is ads... but other than that everything is perfect..,POSITIVE
It's an amazing app but sometimes it randomly turns off the music it self while i am writing something (texting someone),NEGATIVE
"This was so amazing until the new update. I'm really disappointed from this app,any song I want to play I can't play, they play different songs from that playlist it's really irritating the new update of this app is making me sick. I'll surely uninstall it if they keep on doing this to me. We can't skip more than 6 times per hour just because we didn't buy the premier that's really rude. Clear all the issue asap. I don't even want to give 1 star because of it's functions but it's necessary :))",NEGATIVE
Ada are not related to anything I'd be interested in at all but with premium the app is amazing.,POSITIVE
"Like it, is good shows lyrics, but kina bad that u can't individually download songs",NEGATIVE
Very clear sound,POSITIVE
Worst music app ever in the history!! Ads per every 2 songs. Uninstalling it!,NEGATIVE
Not sure I'm really ok with artists not being paid appropriately to access their work. It is very handy though to download playlists to use in the car.,POSITIVE
"While ads are indeed annoying, the most annoying thing on this app is that it adds songs to your playlists without allowing you to remove them. I've tried hiding the songs but nothing works. Not only that but the limited skips are a true pain to many users who can't get premium.",NEGATIVE
Amazing experience but too adds,POSITIVE
Easy to use and great parental settings,POSITIVE
This is a good app for songs and podcast but tgere was a issue in the miniplayer on the notification bar. It was showing multiple screens at a time but I fixed it by changing the app notification settings from my phone settings.,NEGATIVE
Excellent but too many advertisement,NEGATIVE
Excellent app took a while to understand how to use no problems now,NEGATIVE
My music skips like a broken cd. Still skips like a scratched cd ugh. I pay too much for these issues.,NEGATIVE
"Every now and then, the media player won't launch. Which means you can can't fast-forward, rewind or skip thru playlists of podcasts. And occasionally the crashes.",NEGATIVE
local files cannot ne read anymore. please fix.,NEGATIVE
The best ! Very pleased with the app,POSITIVE
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.,POSITIVE
Love the variety of music ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
Excellent sound effect,POSITIVE
"Why is controlling spotify on my pc from my phone so broken now, what are we even paying for?",NEGATIVE
I keep my Spotify updated but it keeps messing up and won't load my Playlist so I'm paying for a horrible service,NEGATIVE
The app is perfect but after I cancelled my subscription Thay take the money every month non stop. In the app it's saying Free Account and still take the money.,NEGATIVE
Why? I play the song and other song playeddd whyyyyyyy I'm so desapoindet,NEGATIVE
"Premium listener since the start. Love that I can get pretty much anything. And believe me, I have very eclectic tastes. I now have the family plan and my family loves it.",POSITIVE
"It is not showing lyrics in my phone ,,,. Now its good ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
Always getting ads,NEGATIVE
"App glitches when running in the background and if you pause with the Bluetooth command, you can't play unless you open the app. Sometimes podcasts pause for no reason. Sometimes the podcast keeps playing, but the ""command bar"" at the bottom disappears and you can't go back or pause. For all these reasons the app has to be closed and reopened frequently. This has been an issue forever now and I don't think the dev team will ever fix it.",NEGATIVE
Easy to use. Love it!,POSITIVE
Please add high resolution audio support...the app is super laggy...and slow.,NEGATIVE
"The app is epic. I don't mind the ads. I just need one thing added and I'd give a 5 start rating no doubt. A personalisation option to change the background in the profile to any default color options like blue, purple, green etc, instead of the default ones, which most of the time don't match with many users' profile pictures. Please try to add this feature",NEGATIVE
Ads after every 2 songs is ridiculous. I know you want people to pay for premium but this makes me want to get pandora again and pay for that.,NEGATIVE
It's not visible in my app section and when I try to play a music it plays another one so that's why I gave it 3 star but it's such a beautiful app for song love it,POSITIVE
It is a amazing but the playlist i want is not available,NEGATIVE
Not working on Samsung S21 Ultra,NEGATIVE
Spotify makes it's so much harder to listen to my fav songs or playlist. The new update is just trush i wanna play song playlist in order but it's just automatically shuffles. Plus when i tried to listen to my playlist i hear songs i didn't even added. Spotify just wants your money at this point,NEGATIVE
Simple and functional app.,POSITIVE
Remove this listenin on ........ popup. We cant search a song.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify, honestly, is one of the greatest platforms out there for music. Basically all I have to say, nothing more to it.",POSITIVE
"Spotify wrapped is fire and Spotify in general just works very well. I like the enhanced option they added a while back and the lyric & syncing they added is nice. A lot of songs don't have lyric data available though, and even then some don't have syncing data. Still, great app and platform to find and listen to music. Get on a family plan with your friends",POSITIVE
"Fix the glitch where if you like a song without actually clicking it to make it play, it doesn't actually add to your liked songs. The heart will fill green and appear so but if you go into album and play song, it's not filled green or 'liked'",NEGATIVE
I keep having to reinstall. App will not function normally for over a month. It plays with the button on pause and there is no way to stop it besides force stop...or uninstall. I pay for premium. About to change to another app.,NEGATIVE
"Where did the sing mode go, it was really fun!",POSITIVE
Very high quality music,POSITIVE
Seamless music and podcast streaming!,POSITIVE
Very nice good work but remove those ads,NEGATIVE
Terrible spotify just wants to take your money and make you go premium for only a month you can only listen to your music without going premium on your computer you can't listen to it on the go.,NEGATIVE
"Very easy to use, and I just love it. Plenty of music to play!",POSITIVE
"Why on earth have you taken a perfectly functional feature like Group sessions and made it worse? You've removed the ability to scan codes, which means when meeting new people I now have to somehow send them a link. You now default to playing music on all devices when I just want the music to come out of the one connected to the speakers. I don't get it, these changes are asinine. Whoever approved these changes need to be fired and you lot need to find the undo button.",NEGATIVE
The app works pretty much as you'd expect--missing some functionality but at the expense of convenience. And yeah it's bad they don't pay their creators hardly anything. But do you know what's criminal about this app? The fact that even if your liked songs are downloaded AND you have a good enough connection to the Internet (which shouldn't even be required if the songs are already stored locally) you CANNOT load your liked songs. You have about a fifty percent chance to access it at any point,NEGATIVE
Great sound quality and a wide range of music suggestions offered.,POSITIVE
"Love the app but the Samsung/android glitch is annoying. Having to ""force stop"" the app almost daily to reset the glitch and playback issues.",NEGATIVE
The sound quality is best but the interrupting ads aur so annoying..,NEGATIVE

Mobile App keeps saying I am offline so I cannot login but I have Internet connection,NEGATIVE
terrible on mobile i need a subscription to listen to music i want to listen to?,NEGATIVE
"It would have been better if they were lyrics or like the iTunes,01/07/2022 thank you for the lyrics ðŸ¥°",NEGATIVE
"You people are utterly useless. Everytime there is an update for the app, something goes wrong. Now the app keeps saying there is no internet connection despite there being connection and all my songs are missing from the list. What are you people doing over there? And I'm a bloody premium member. Getting sick and tired of this.",NEGATIVE
This app is complete trash. Other apps that provide the same service are much more useful than spotify,NEGATIVE
Trying it our with light piano ðŸŽ¹ music ðŸŽ¶..very relaxing.,POSITIVE
Can't download music offline even after purchasing premium plan,NEGATIVE
Worst app sometimes which I was listening won't come particularlly that podcast not opens please fix the bloody bug Spotify...........,NEGATIVE

"I've been trying to pay for Spotify premium family with my access and each time I input my card details, it shows ""The payment failed. Please try again, use a different card or a different payment method"" But I've used this card for over 3 months",NEGATIVE
"Hello. I've been always using this app and before this, the widget that I put at the home screen always looks like the colour of the song album that I am listening too but I don't know if you are not allowing to use that update anymore or what but I love that update so can you please bring them back?",POSITIVE
AWFULL APP DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU WILL REGRET. LITERALLY SPEAKING .I WANNA GIVE THIS APP -1000Ã—INFINITE RATE .,NEGATIVE
Superior to all other music sharing apps.,POSITIVE

Why i didn't have the sing-along feature yet? Not available on both mobile app and desktop app ðŸ˜ž i just updated the latest version. How to get it??,NEGATIVE

Typical scum bag company makes it difficult to unsubscribe. Their algorithm is a waste of time it wont fund anythi g si.ilar to what u listen to.,NEGATIVE
Why am I listening to songs that aren't on my playlist which is leading me to skipping so I can actually hear what I want and that's wasting skips ðŸ˜,NEGATIVE
Hope to be a free app :'( or make it to have a less advertisement,NEGATIVE
"This app LOVES to stop playing randomly. Do you enjoy listening to music or a podcast? Hopefully you enjoy either one stopping on a dime for no reason at all...because it will. Whether on Bluetooth or not, be prepared for your listening experience to be interrupted by total silence on a regular basis. You'll have to pick up your phone to open the the app and restart it manually. This becomes impossible if you're driving. I've done everything i can to remedy this to no avail. Please fix!",NEGATIVE
Im really enjoying Spotify,POSITIVE
Amazing for podcast ðŸ‘â¤ï¸ Quality level is Best ðŸ‘â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
"I used have music while I was driving. Now I can't have music or there'll be an accident from constantly having to make sure my screen is on 24/7 like this is YouTube music. I downloaded this because I wanted to listen to music while I drive, not be a mayhem. And I do a lot of driving. So now it's just been empty space in my car for almost a year. So no 5 stars definitely until its fixed. It's a problem you don't care about I know. You have a radio. Just go home and listen then. Not the point.",NEGATIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
Good experiencing on spotify music,POSITIVE
"They just say listen add free songs for 30 mins, but after 1/2 songs, when I change the song, advertisements comes.",NEGATIVE

"Too little enjoyment of music played. It's need further upgrades for truetune,360 and spatial sounds play.",NEGATIVE
its really good and easy to use. i use it for a long long time. maybe you can give us discount hahahaha keep it up/good!,POSITIVE
Each time I make a play list it always adds damn song that I don't want to listen to and I can't remove them and that's why i rate it a 1/5,POSITIVE
"no functions for convenient listening (I can't even pick the concrete song in the playlist), no pluses at all, uncomfortable application",NEGATIVE
One of the best music apps you can use no cap,POSITIVE
"Cool idea: when enlarging the real-time lyrics, you should be able to tap above or below sending the song forward or backward where you tapped ðŸ™‚",NEGATIVE
Spotify is good Because we can choose any music we want so we don't need YouTube,POSITIVE
"Trash .... my spotify has been giving me issues for days. Music is just not playing, I had to even delete my playlists. I'm unsubscribing",NEGATIVE
Now are days hearing to many ad even in 30 minutes at least 3-4 ad just like one song one ad. But primer is good. Low price also,POSITIVE
It's nice to have music at my fingertips,POSITIVE
Good until you need to get premium. It stops you from doing anything after.,NEGATIVE

This app so great but Add is coming again and again just after 2 song Why so many adds plz do something,POSITIVE
What is the fun of remainder ads remove remainder ads for the God sake,NEGATIVE
"this app is great and paying for premium was absolutely worth it, but i have two issues: 1. equalization, there is no place to adjust bass or treble and i that makes me prefer other music apps sometimes. 2. shuffling, the shuffle option in spotify does not work correctly and normally dumps similar songs next to eachother, which is inconvenient. other than that it's an amazing app and would definitely recommend for streaming and downloading music on your phone, computer, tv etc.",NEGATIVE
I had no problems with Spotify until a few days ago.. I used to link it to set my alarm but now it's not qorking the same.. Fix that issue and it's one of the best music apps ever....,POSITIVE
"Hey plz make some shortcuts to like any song, add to queue, etc You have shortcuts for adding to queue for ""today's top hits"" section but that doesn't work on songs when u open any album of any artist. Plz consider making app even more convenient to user... Also plz add feature to customize home so that we can always add our favorite artist or any segment like ""TTH"" to that place After these features app is gonna be almost perfect.",NEGATIVE
"A good app for streaming music. My only issue is the Equaliser is not easily accessible. You need to go to Settings and scroll right down to find it. This is a bit of a pain, as I need to adjust it almost every time I use Spotify, depending on the music I'm playing or the device I'm playing it on.",NEGATIVE
"They'll put money on hold for themselves in case you Subscribe, don't look see things pending in my account",NEGATIVE
The app is amazing good app no ads just music... its real music.good vibes,POSITIVE
I hate this app because it won't let me change the song it forces me to finish the song that is playing,NEGATIVE
"This version its worse you cant play a song,The old version is better than this please change for us if not you are going to lose,its becoming worse",NEGATIVE
I'm using spotify as a premium member since multiple years on multiple different devices. Experience with this app is getting worse every day. Here's a collection of issues I had so far on Android (as I said it seems to be getting worse by the day) - crashes - freezes - random redownloading of your already downloaded music - wacky behavior when in offline mode - randomly starting to play music even if you don't want to - not showing the correct song - not being able to stop a song,NEGATIVE
I have a complaint . Spotify app will be not working on my device please clear the complain sudently .,NEGATIVE
"Song recommendations is superb! But at atist profile in discovery section if possible pls ad- single, ep, album in 3 rows or column . So it will be more user friendly.",NEGATIVE

Awesome and Easy-user!,POSITIVE
"Full of ads, a lot of times I get up to 5 30-second ads successively It's really annoying",NEGATIVE
"For the most part, the app works well, just occasionally you might have to 'force close' when it misbehaves, especially when switching to different devices. The sheer amount of music available is staggering.",POSITIVE
Very easy to find any song you like no matter how old it is,NEGATIVE
I really like spotify but only because i bought premimum,NEGATIVE
"When searching in ""your library"" it no longer shows playlists, it just shows artists. I want to look for my playlists under my library, not artists please change it back (4 updates later & it's still not fixed). And please stop pushing podcasts on the home screen, I never listen to them and even after selecting 'not interested in this show' the same show appears again. In fact 80% of the home page is recommendations that I will never click on, making it pointless and not worth checking.",NEGATIVE
It's really a good app.... ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ ðŸ˜€ I love it ðŸ˜Šwhen I'm bored then I listen the songs on spotify for my mind fresh...nd the songs make me relax..ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,POSITIVE

Why so hard for payment premium now? Why it must be with credit card?,NEGATIVE
This a awsome music app i love it........â¤ï¸ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"It's gotten so bad recently. The ads are so much louder than the music. After hearing a mellow song and being blasted at double the volume an ad really sucks. Now the app also strated to just stop playing and needs to be force shut down, most of the time it seems to get stuck at playing an ad, even though my internet connection is good.",NEGATIVE
This app very good every one should try it,POSITIVE
Less than intuitive user interface.,NEGATIVE
It is very nice app. We can listen song with playing games also...ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,POSITIVE

Fantastic music app and probablythe best,POSITIVE
Now I can't control the audio level with the volume keys on my phone. Brilliant change in functionality ðŸ™„,NEGATIVE
The app and quality is damn good but I just suggest that there should be an option to chat with your friends if you add that it would be fantasticðŸ’¥,POSITIVE
"Idk what is my Spotify's problem like whenever I open the app it says ""no internet connection"" and then i have to refresh it like 2-3 times then it works properly also sometimes when I play a playlist it jumps to another song of the playlist means it doesn't play one after one it jumps after 2-3 songs and play that another song.",NEGATIVE
Why do you still force adds if I already pay the premium subscription?,NEGATIVE
I tried playing a song but it played a suggested song,NEGATIVE
It's very easy to search music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
"The free version of Spotify is great on pc and the xbox, but terrible on phone. I only use it to edit my playlists. Just use youtube.",NEGATIVE
"I am using premium, but I can't find the canvas option in my account. Is it just in my case or the option has not come in Bangladesh yet? please fix this ðŸ™‚",NEGATIVE

So many fun things and songs,POSITIVE
It shuffles into other song instead of the song I'm looking for,NEGATIVE
Umm it was great before but currently there's too much ads and the limited skips are kinda annoying.... Overall it's pretty decent ( might be better idk ) compared to other music apps,NEGATIVE
It gives me so many options i just feel like 10 skips an hour would be a major plus.,NEGATIVE
Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY,POSITIVE
"I can always get to music I enjoy provided I have signal. Been using the app for years, been using premium and it's entirely worth every cent. The only thing that gets annoying is that the songs I use the feature to ignore/skip still will play when I'm playing albums and I have to skip them manually. Love the songs the personalized albums come up with though.",NEGATIVE

There Are Lot Of Songs & Playlists To Listen.....Really An Good AppðŸŽ§,POSITIVE
"Why is it that we pay for premium but still get ads for every page on the app? Who gives any about podcasts?? Seriously, we aren't paying for a new set of advertisements. Maybe try listening to your consumers? It has also been glitching lately as well... it is the only app that will not connect to the internet.",NEGATIVE
Nice to listen to music while just walking,POSITIVE
"All features are good except the problem of showing no internet connection while searching a song even when there is good internet connection, i think this issue is faced by many users.",POSITIVE
It's so great I love it so much I have no complaints,POSITIVE
Good suggestions. Great dance music options when it gets me in the moose,POSITIVE

Very useful application form song,POSITIVE
The ad experience is horrific and if I make a playlist containing 20 or so songs I'm lucky if I get to hear a single 1 from it I used use this app exclusively and now its unbearable,NEGATIVE

If they fix this I will bring it to 5 stars but right now, it's 2 stars",POSITIVE
I love this app. It has so many genres to pick from. So many songs to chose and you can follow your friends and listen to there playlist. I like how for instance Salish Matter isn't like Drake but you can still listen to her music. â¤,POSITIVE

Very easy to use and handy when ant got any data,POSITIVE
It's become really annoying to have to always restart the app so I can see what song is playing on the home screen. Even then it doesn't show up. I just expect more from an app I pay for. It's super inconvenient and I use this app all day everyday. Please see to fixing these bugs Spotify.,NEGATIVE
"too much ads, hate it",NEGATIVE
"Spotify free used to work normal with ads. After purchasing premium, search results, song selection, literally any action keeps the app loading forever !",NEGATIVE
It's cool with premium but without it I can't even select songs without premium.,NEGATIVE

Great music app I love it I highly recommend it ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Most entertaining and user friendly good app...,POSITIVE
"It's always been a great streaming service. I've let my subscription cancel for years and come back to my same massive library, fully intact.",POSITIVE
The podcasting has been pretty bad with losing your place and altogether skipping to the end when you try to start it up making it completely un enjoyable for me to the point where I didn't listen but something seems to have changed in the last few days and things have worked normally so whatever you guys might have done good job,NEGATIVE
I've used this app for about a month now and I'm 99% happy with it. Every now and then there are little glitches but they are easily fixed. Much better than Amazon music!,POSITIVE
"Awesome experience with Spotify, try it it's really amazing ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜„",POSITIVE
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??",NEGATIVE
"I don't know about the paid version; ask someone else about that. As for the free version, way too many ads to even think about enjoying music, not to mention all the politically correct podcasts and musicians. Uninstall...",NEGATIVE
I like the app. But why have you been restricting Neil Young songs?,NEGATIVE
Very enjoyable and easy to use,POSITIVE

This use to be a great app but there is way too many ads between songs. 1 or 2 is fine for the free version but 6 or 7 is ridiculous. I will be searching for a new music app unfortunately,NEGATIVE
good app latest & Old song,POSITIVE
"to me spotify is so easy,with a robust library from old to new and all genres,i just absolutely must have it every day",POSITIVE
"Well, it continously says offline and to get online to listen to anything. I am online....ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ˜’",NEGATIVE
I'm honestly thinking about canceling my family plan cause you removed shuffle play all my song bring it back and I'll stay,POSITIVE
"Great, a wonderful discovery!",POSITIVE
it has all songs and I love how you can have a Playlist also a suggestion is where u can watch the music video while listening to the song,POSITIVE
Satisfying and entertaining and also a relaxing school of learning.,POSITIVE
best music app I've had...they have all the songs from each genre that i like to listen to and new songs that I enjoy!,POSITIVE
"This is for Jill Wells Art mostly. I've enjoyedspotifymostly(beenGreatly annoyedattimesAlso) for years once I figured out how to makemy ownPlaylists.I was no longer at the mercy of shuffle play unlessIwabted2b and could also key queuefrom playlists made. Have you consider making then dnlg list,then go offline to listen. Sometimes its the best way. My only gripe isIwish there was a automatic filter that wouldnt allow me to DLsONGS I've already DL!! That would make my life 4000+ songs ALOT better",NEGATIVE
Great app has all of my favorite music choices,POSITIVE
Love it's to listen the music I Want,POSITIVE
I really like the app just that the ads can be really disruptive. But you can make playlists for you and your friends so I say its a pretty nice app.,POSITIVE
I can listen to the music I prefer.,POSITIVE
No need to say anthing but the fact that its just good,POSITIVE
Too many adds . Can enjoy music.,POSITIVE
Its the one of the best music applications i have ever used. It also has the great podcasts,POSITIVE
"I love the app , there is nothing wrong with it . Just perfect. I rate it 100/100.Thank you",POSITIVE
"Love the app..the lyrics viewer just got an update which makes the experience so much better..another feature I would really like spotify to adopt and I especially think it will change the way people use Spotify drastically is the addition of videos, I know it may be a very difficult thing to do but if it's possible I hope it can be done in the future and also when is the long awaited HiFi audio features coming.",NEGATIVE
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it ðŸ˜».,NEGATIVE
Premium here. It works well ... For about 10 seconds per song.,POSITIVE
"I get the whole advertisement but at this point you're overdoing it. I only hear about three to two songs and then I hear about 5 ads, are you kidding me?? Two songs and in-between there's two ads Chill out with the advertising it's really difficult for me to enjoy your damn app and I'm a teenager so I can't afford your premium but at least give us a break from the advertising. I hear more ads than music my god",NEGATIVE
It's perfect on my watch Samsung Galaxy watch for classic,POSITIVE
I am using for almost a year but i dont know how to listen offline music after get downloaded ?,NEGATIVE
"I like the newly added recommendations being played through your history list songs after they've ended. It's a nice touch and a good way to find new music. Please don't kill this feature, it'll be very disappointing, I honestly don't mind not having the history list play by song.",NEGATIVE
The audio of the songs is not consistent. Some are too soft i can hardly hear.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify the music is endless and so worth the subscription!,POSITIVE
Gives great music at touch of a button,POSITIVE
I didn't realize until it went away that it starts you off with a free sample of premium. I liked the app until premium went away. Now you can't even pick the songs you want. You can only shuffle playlists. And if you try making your own Playlist Spotify adds songs to it that have nothing to do with the ones you added yourself. Over all I'm very disappointed with my experience with this app. It's pretty cool with premium but the free version is disappointing.,NEGATIVE
"I like your 30 mins uninterrupted, but its hard to enjoy when you software runs with the processing power of a 2 year old with down syndrome! Take a lesson from YouTube and actually play what people search for!",NEGATIVE
Very useful in a quite time,POSITIVE
"Spotify is an excellent music app,i just love this",POSITIVE
"I rate spotify 3 stars because I loved it, I enjoyed it. if not because Im not able to play my downloaded songs while offline even if im on premium, I could have been given them 5 stars. because of this, i just undo my subscription",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is literally the best. You can listen to any song you want and it's better than the competition. Only downside is the 4 advertisements that play every 15 minutes. Other than that though, Spotify is great.",POSITIVE
"Good app, yet recently I've noticed that alot of my songs are being removed for some reason? Would like to know why please.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is spot on,POSITIVE
Great for podcast and mostly all music highly recommend,POSITIVE
Yes I would write you a fight cuz I love Spotify but since I got premium for almost a year now y'all have taken two payments off of my card,NEGATIVE
"I find this app ok, to many freaking ads though ðŸ™„",POSITIVE
"I had Spotify for years now and I was always very happy with it. Now for the first time in my life I have Spotify without premium and it is the biggest piece of s*** I have ever encountered. I would give it 0 stars or less, but with premium it is actually very good so two stars.",POSITIVE
Ads are annoying but other than that it's fine,POSITIVE
"Don't add songs to my custom Playlist that I put my songs on, I make custom Playlists because I want to only hear the songs on said Playlist not what you recommend to me",NEGATIVE
This app is the best app in the sector of free streaming of music and audio!! Though sometimes you may get several ads but you can purchase an individual premium plan for just 119 per month which is reasonable.And the quality of sound is of top quality! This app is unbeatable.I love this app and using since 2020.ðŸ¤—,POSITIVE
Alot of my playlist is not downloading,NEGATIVE
"Best music app. I've been using it for about 2 or 3 years and it's been great. The ads are kind of a problem but it doesn't really bother me. I hate that there's only 6 skips per hour. But the app is still great. Has all the music i look up. Country, rap, all the stuff I love. 10/10",POSITIVE
I love this spotify app but the adds are more,POSITIVE
Awesome to listen to my favorite music anytime!,POSITIVE
Okay Spotify if its free thin you guys need to stick to that no b.s with limited skips really in my opinion Spotify needs to be pulled off the app store just because of how messed up Spotify is it plays songs I have no interest in and the add wall is so bad I only use it for my xbox,NEGATIVE
Plays and adds random music that you can't get rid of. Won't let me play the songs I wanna play. I hate the new version,POSITIVE
Get to listen to my music which is perfect,POSITIVE
For whatever reason I can't scroll to see the different genres/moods for my liked songs.,NEGATIVE
Wonderful music to work by and easy to select tunes and artist that I enjoy the most. Great variety,POSITIVE
"Awesome, but 3 stars for a few reasons; 1. App crashes consistently on my phone. 2. I have to wait a hour just to get 6 skips. 3. Umm.. No third reason but three stars is my rating",NEGATIVE
An update of the app took it all away. Will uninstall.,NEGATIVE
okay no one wants their playlists to be shuffled all the time bruh and those limited skips-,NEGATIVE
"Great app, easy to use,.never any problems",POSITIVE
Vary awaome platform to use. Everything is so easy to learn. I have yet to not find a song I searched....,NEGATIVE
I love my music and especially Morbid crime podcast!,POSITIVE
Most of the play list are fake/false. Like u search for lets say linkin park andthe playlist named literally linkin park is having every kind of songs but linkinpark. Waste of money,NEGATIVE
Love how i get two back to back ads ... like why?,POSITIVE
"Normally I would put 5 stars as I love Spotify. But while I thought the issue had been fixed, I updated the app today and once again, while connected to any Bluetooth device, my music is stopping randomly, multiple times, on EVERY SINGLE song. It's not an issue with my phone as I do not have this issue with any other media streaming app, and it's not the Bluetooth device because it happens on multiple devices. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
Tbh i have a few suggestions to the app But i love how you can watch 3 ads to get 30 minutes free listening i love that Ill update my comment and ill add the suggestions later.,NEGATIVE
Recent updates have made the app completely useless for a month now even though I'm paying for the service. It won't load anything or play anything. Pretty disappointed from a service I use daily.,NEGATIVE
I've spent years building a playlist and all of them are gone now. I was first a free user and have been on the paid family plan for the last year. Everything is gone since the last two updates and I can't use it at all. Edit: I discovered the app works on Roku but not my android phone. I obviously can't use my Roku in the car! Please fix it!,NEGATIVE
"I get not being able to do some things but some are just ridiculous, heres a list . 1- not being able to choose a song on a playlist 2- not being able to chance the second of the song 3 cant go back to the song before 4 NO QUEUE 5 limited skips 6 CANT REPLAY A SONG??? 6 being stuck with randomizer on 7 WHY DOES IT PLAY RANDOM SONGS BRO THEYRE NOT EVEN ON MY PLAYLIST ???",NEGATIVE
STOP WITH THE ADDS AFTER EVERY SONG! Fair enough every 30mins. BUT. EVERY. SONG. Is an overkill. Be a bit considerate for those of of who are clearly trying to budget with not spending $110/year for music.,NEGATIVE
"app just suddenly ceased to work properly, can't even browse or play any songs (samsung galaxy s9 plus)",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is great and I don't mind ads every once in awhile but the ads are starting to get excessive. I swear it feels like I'll listen to three songs and get three ads after. Sometimes even after the ""30 mins of uninterrupted listening"" ad I'll get an ad two songs later.",NEGATIVE
This is just an amazing platform that gives you variety and Platform Church (Rested Life) content everything is in it and our members love it.,POSITIVE
"Bots add thing to ur playlist. Cant even play a regular song u searched up, it just puts a random song on you dont like. I miss the old spotify.",NEGATIVE
I like the app it's a good music app but I find the library limited when compared to YouTube mother or less commercial breaks and for shorter time. I never look at Spotify before but clearly they're more options comparing the two music platforms it's like apples and oranges give it a shot tell me what you think,NEGATIVE
You can't play specific songs unless you pay. You can get free alternatives so don't shill for some big corporation - there are better ways to support smaller artists.,NEGATIVE
I can't play some 8d music. It sucks,NEGATIVE
My go to app when I wanna listen to music or a podcast,NEGATIVE
Easy access to play my favorite music at any time. Easy to find my favorite artist and the songs with lyrics,POSITIVE
Hey Spotify why you always beg for money with your adds ever 5 minutes. have some standards reduce your adds a little bit or should I say begging for money like a begger,NEGATIVE
Very nice i love spotify,POSITIVE
Great it allows you to listen to music while on other apps,POSITIVE
"I swim and listen to Spotify, the whole family loves music.",POSITIVE
It sucks I use it when i can't find a certain thing on SoundCloud but that's about it. It's pretty trash,NEGATIVE
I've had Spotify for over 2 years and they've been great. Thanks Spotify!!!,POSITIVE
Love all of the choices you can make Groups of music you can even search for,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify Premium. It's affordable, I can listen from all my devices, and I get showtime as a bonus!",POSITIVE
"Many bugs, delay, freeze and problems on my phone.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify premium is still my favorite music app. Where else would I be able to get three months of premium for just $9.99(for ALL three months). Best deal ever. Thanks for the ability to listen to anything I want ad Free! I've got to let you know, that you should definitely subscribe to Spotify premium today. Keep cranking out the tunes, we'll keep listening.",POSITIVE
"I need to update but until then it is really bad because when you play a song, instead of playing that song it plays like 100000000 others and it takes REALLY long so yeah",NEGATIVE
i think this will be my last year on spotify i wont be renewing my premium since they removed the widget which is the best feature they have.,POSITIVE
Been using Spotify for 8 years and no complaints!,NEGATIVE
Good music experience All songs r available in thisðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,POSITIVE
It's nice playing songs YOU want when YOU want them DESPITE the ads that make them FREE!!,POSITIVE
"PLEASE make playlists for podcasts where it will play the latest episodes of eg. three podcasts I have added to a playlist. Like in daily drive, but customisable!",NEGATIVE
"Awesome, it has every song you want",POSITIVE
App has all songs I search and is very efficient and gives best music sound too. I love it.,POSITIVE
This app is good but I hate the new update I hate how you can't pick the songs you want to hear without Premium its so annoying,NEGATIVE
Lately there's been Glitches in the showing of Album Artwork,NEGATIVE
Has way too many adds and they are supper long and you can't pick the song you want to listen to unless you pay for a subscription otherwise it would be ok,NEGATIVE
Great music ads are repetitive but my choice not too pay,NEGATIVE
I use the app. Often ond enjoy the music and song that are available,POSITIVE
I love spotify and I have been listening music on it for several months but nowadays the app just stops working while a song is playing or you click on a artist and the music pauses. I had already tried restarting my phone or reinstalling the app but it didn't work. It would be very helpful if you fix that bug.,NEGATIVE
Fix the app its not starting,NEGATIVE
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNTIL THEY FIX THE PROBLEM WITH ANDROID, this has been going on for weeks. Spotify will not start. I have tried everything that has been suggested and I pay for a premium subscription.",NEGATIVE
I was listening to music suddenly it stopped and they logged me out i am trying to log in several times with my one plus 7 but it is showing something went wrong,NEGATIVE
This app is not working smoothly,NEGATIVE
"Everything's okay, really really good. But I have problem about when I want to share the song to stories IG, font is so big than normal. Pls fix it.",NEGATIVE
"I've had awesome service with you guys, Thank you very much and have a blessed day.",POSITIVE
"3 stars, solid app. However after the newest update ive been experiencing some difficulties, im unable to play most songs, including from playlists. itll play for about 9-11 seconds then stop and not play again. If this gets fixed I'll make this review 5 stars for sure.",POSITIVE
Love this streaming platform but would appreciate if they step up their sound quality ðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
love this app!!! podcasts also help me a lot.,POSITIVE
"2/5 because of the inability to delete your recently played history now. Edit 1/5 because now you can't even choose what song in your playlist to play, you can't reorder your songs, AND you have limited skips?! I fail to understand your reasoning. The ads haven't bothered me (yet) but should it I would rate this 0 stars if I could, only redeeming factor is the quantity of songs, opposed to the quality of the app.",NEGATIVE
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great.",NEGATIVE
"One of the best music apps. Hiding songs plays them anyway, so what's the point of that feature? Song categories are getting ridiculous but what can we expect in this new world.",POSITIVE
"Myself, I enjoy sitting and listening to the old time radio stories from my childhood.",POSITIVE
Too many adds,NEGATIVE
"Music is my life and I mean to find almost every single song I want is absolutely awesome. Great job and and awesome effort to keep Spotify up to date, thx Spotify teamðŸ’ªðŸ¼ðŸ”¥",POSITIVE
Spotify is not the app is literally like when you click to play your playlist it's not like how it used to be now just generates on some random song and it's not fun I can't start from the beginning and it limits how many songs you can swipe you can only do six per hour why Spotify tell me cuz this is not making sense like I downloaded this app to listen to music but now I can't and I don't like the app anymore that's why I give the one star cuz of this Spotify needs to update their pictures,NEGATIVE
I love the app but i hate when i play a song it gives me another song of the same creator its really annoying,NEGATIVE
I had used iheart radio for years. I will no longer use iheart due to them pushing their GAY agenda on their users. I got tired of gay ads every 10 minutes. I switched to Spotify and hope they are better.,NEGATIVE
"The best app ever, i wish the premium would be cheaper but I just can't live without it",NEGATIVE
"I listen to podcast everyday, worth the family subscription",POSITIVE
"Annoying that it starts playing randomly in my car. It auto starts when I turn my car on, when I answer a call, when I hang up, when I turn my stereo on, etc. If I turn off permissions to avoid this then it doesn't work properly. Like the service, hate the app.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, but the removal of car integration sucks. You had a feature that worked well, for tons of people, and removed it just to push your own hardware, screwing over everyone.",NEGATIVE
"such a good app, with or without premium they have lots of songs and i know it can be a little annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist but the songs they add are based off your recent searches so theyre not even bad songs and at least when you watch and ad you get rewarded with 30 mins of uninterupted listening! they have basically every song. such a great app... and its free too!",POSITIVE
Living below the poverty level and getting to listen to the vast collection available for free is wonderful. Sure I'd like the perks of membership but I can deal with having way less ads than radio ever had.,NEGATIVE
"My music sometimes turns off even when my sleep timer isn't set, but not often. I really like the app, but it's unfortunate that we must pay so much to access premium features. I guess $5 would be alright, but $10 for just music seems like a lot. Even streaming services like Disney+ charge less, but the premium features are still nice (I got it so I could download my music to listen to when I travel).",POSITIVE
I love to play Spotify ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š ðŸŽ§,POSITIVE
Updates use too much data.,NEGATIVE
Fantastic a great mix of everything and anything.... Tunetastic,POSITIVE
"The leader in its field, top quality app.",POSITIVE
"It's my daily use app, One of the few & One of the Best out there.",POSITIVE
The annoying back to back ads just spoils the whole mood.,NEGATIVE
To much ad. Frustrating,NEGATIVE
This is not app this is life for depressed one to come out of depression,NEGATIVE
The so takes forever to load playlists,NEGATIVE
Lyrics aren't available for any of the songs (latest updated),NEGATIVE
"Better than Apple itunes by far. More music different styles of music ðŸŽ¶ absolutely worth $9.99 a month I don't listen to my radio or pay for XM radio when I can listen to anything without commercials and radio talk. I like apple music. But nothing beats"" Spotify""!!!!",NEGATIVE
One of the most favourite application but now it's the most worst app and I hate it. Always keep saying no internet connection blah blah. No songs play. Why? Very disappointing. Never expect this from this app. It's quite famous and I think popularity makes people blind.,NEGATIVE
This is the best app to listen to music to,POSITIVE
"Nice, got my lyrics. Thanks",POSITIVE
Paid accounts still have advertisements on podcasts,NEGATIVE
Excellent musical choices!,POSITIVE
Never had any issues. Music is always current and I like that there is a wide variety to choose from.,POSITIVE
Want better tamil lyrics in both english and Tamil. Sometimes autoplay song genre based on search is unrelated. Ad appearing in between two songs is quite hindrance,NEGATIVE
I do love this app for all of my music. Except for the fact that if you don't pay you don't get the premium which means you don't get anything that you want. You have unlimited number of skips for the premium and you don't with the free version. I can make my own playlist with a premiums can't with regular. I guess it is worth the $9.99 to get the premium. Unless you don't use it as much as I do which is everyday.,POSITIVE
It doesn't working says run time exception many times I have deleted and reinstall it then also it's saying than useless app,NEGATIVE
Why can't u just send password reset? U send to email and I only can open email in my phone. Cannot use other devices,NEGATIVE
I love spotify I've been using it for something around 3-4 years and have personally not really had any problems and I use this app almost everyday it's easy to use you can find some really good artists and songs just by listening to your discover weekly which recommends you songs based off what you have been listening to,POSITIVE
I used to have pandora but switched to this and never looked back highly recommend switchingðŸ’¯ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
"Premium user. Managed to somehow turn car mode back on in settings on my previous phone, now it's greyed out and there is no SAFE driving option. Horrible planning on their part to discontinue car mode before having a replacement ready. Another issue is shuffle, I'll have hours of music in a playlist and it still plays multiple songs from one artist. Also wish I was recommended better music, rarely find something new I like in Discover Weekly.",NEGATIVE
All songs all the time but without premium the ads are a little bit annoying,NEGATIVE
Best streaming online app for music and your favourite artiste.,POSITIVE
Great music selection and very easy to navigate,POSITIVE
"Good but I got a message ""something went wrong, try again"" I've triple checked and everything but it still appears that and it logged me out of my account and only that account that gives me that messagd",NEGATIVE
This up is good for listening to music you can even do it when you turn your phone off it's great,POSITIVE
It is the best app for streaming music ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
The app was great until it changed my play/pause button from middle to left. I asked twitter support for help but they couldn't rectify the problem after multiple attempts. they changed back,NEGATIVE
Does not let me play my entire library. There are too many albums to like individually,NEGATIVE
Really good for music. No bofering for me.,POSITIVE
Its worst app so much ads ...,NEGATIVE
"I enjoy listening to podcasts, but the app has problems. It keeps locking up and closing on my Galaxy 22, and listening to downloaded content. Primarily having to switch between listening Online and Offline. I live in the sticks and do not have good cell service or wifi at home & listen to podcasts. There is absolutely no possible reason I should have to switch between modes to listen to content I have downloaded to device! I paid for service so I would be able to download & listen.",NEGATIVE
"ABSOLUTE TRASH ON MOBILE. All I wanted to do was make a Playlist of 4 songs and play it. Didn't even play a single song of mine and just kept playing random ""similar"" songs, song after song. After I had to waste time googling for a fix. Found the fix and turned off ""autoplay similar songs."" Still didn't play my Playlist songs. TRASH ON MOBILE. Not to mention I remade the Playlist from scratch about 5 times and it still didn't play a single song of mine.",NEGATIVE
"I miss linear notes, cover art, lyrics (like real ones, not autotech guessing), bios (accurate), musicians, vocal, producing credits and please get rid of the fake albums for which none of the songs are available to hear. Other than that, and the constant glitches in sound, it's just dandy.",NEGATIVE
It's a good app and i would have given 5 stars but after new update my Spotify is stuck at Spotify logo whenever I launch application.Developers pls fix this as soon as possible,NEGATIVE
There should be an option to remove songs which we don't like from auto generated playlists.,NEGATIVE
As some songs are not available at it so m giving it 4 stars and hope u gonna fix it asap.. â‰¥ï¹â‰¤,POSITIVE
pls reduce ur ads some of us cant buy premium cuz their parents think its a waste of money.,NEGATIVE
Works well in car and car picked up via bloothtooth automatically.,POSITIVE
This is a star I gave him a lot Why can't I listen to it in Iran? Then your countries start pondering and say freedom and ...? Then we can not listen to our country?..A student ... teenager ... you do not value us listening to our favorite songs because we are from Iran... Do you think we love ourselves here?We are in pain but we do not have the right to speak ... This is just music ....Do you really take this from us?,NEGATIVE
enjoying listening music.,POSITIVE
Overall the app is very good but we cant downlaod the song without premium if you remove thing your rating got 4.8,NEGATIVE
Spotify is a joy to use. I love the playlists it automatically generates. The playlists are based on the type of songs you listen to. This introduces you to other artists you might not have heard of. You can also create your own playlists.,POSITIVE
Hi thanks my enjoying times o.k. function great my system I use stops two day after heat resistance? Cool,POSITIVE
"Lost without this app. I have more access to any music and podcasts than ever , part of my life now",POSITIVE
"Worst, there's no place for those who try to play it without subscription. There's a ad in every single song",NEGATIVE
Sound quality is decreasing...,NEGATIVE
Well.......what.....to....say.....about this app it's great as you all know and heard of. For the ones who are K-POP fans it's great for them.....â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜˜,POSITIVE
I use spotify everyday and keep adding to my playlist! Limited ads and I easily find artist and songs. Highly recommend this app!!,POSITIVE
"Too many bugs too often. It's great when it works, but i would expect it to maintain its functionality as I'm paying for a premium service. Pretty disappointing with all the bugs and regular glitches",NEGATIVE
Excellent and convenient,POSITIVE
Very laggy on android phones,NEGATIVE
I don't like ads between music. And don't want to take subscription.,NEGATIVE
Best songs quality and very easy to use . ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"perfect for anyone who wants to listen to podcasts and music free with ads. my only problem being it will sometimes not let me log in, but this is rare",POSITIVE
So many issues with the app.. I ve had spotify for years but seriously this is getting annoying. Also the 'spotify community' page is an absolute joke. Someone just replies with the classic clean re install 'solution' and marks it as solved. I have 40 GBS of music.. if I have to re download one more time I swear I am gonna lose it.,NEGATIVE
The sound is very clear.,POSITIVE
"It's the go to app for music. The swipe gesture was a long awaited and great addition. It would be worth 5 stars, but I have unliked songs too many times accidentally due to the position of the like button. If it were only visible inside the player it would mean less accidental touches.",NEGATIVE
Simply simply lovely.,POSITIVE
"Solid expirence, high quality music listening.",POSITIVE
Why is there no repeat button???,NEGATIVE
Love being able to travel intimate to whatever decade I'm feeling atvthe moment!,POSITIVE
Don't know happaned to this app but it is slow now.....to play or find a song takes forever now... it is very irritating and i seriously consider unsubscribing and quitting using it,NEGATIVE

"My fav music source- in the car and at home, meets all the needs and adding to playlists is super easy",POSITIVE
Its a great app I could listen any song I wanted its really amazing but the only problem is the add you will have to listen adds more than songs its horrible please do something about that add,NEGATIVE
"App is broken with newest update. Spoke with Tebro Z through the web support messaging system and after going through the usual suggestions, was told the issue has been sent to devs. Will update review if/when issue is fixed.",NEGATIVE
It's okay but to many ads and they are long,NEGATIVE
It needs to work offline ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"i can't login because everytime i tried to login, it always says that i'm offline, when i'm not. i turned on my mobile data. isn't there any solution for this problem? it's really bugging me",NEGATIVE
I would have done it a zero but that's not possible so I give you a 1 it won't let me restart my password because I'm on infant I'm on infinite Shuffle I'm having a mental breakdown about it and I hope your company gets bankrupt ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,NEGATIVE
"Adds are too much, would have subscribed the premium version but they charge too much.. at least lesser the adds",NEGATIVE
Good.. I can listen to my favorite music really easy.,POSITIVE
Nice layout and some good suggestions,POSITIVE
This app is horrible I tried to make an account with my when I was born but it's not working I think they need to work on this cuz I'm just doing what I have to do I wanted to test it out and listen to some music not on YouTube and it's horrible utterly horrible I don't understand how people will like this but I will not recommend this,NEGATIVE
Love the quality and availability of my favourite by a push of a button,POSITIVE
Best place for podcasts,POSITIVE
Very hard to use and why must i have extra music in my playlist that i don't want,NEGATIVE
"Recently, today I could not play my liked songs, all it does is play songs I've not even seen nor heard of, and I'm starting to get angry.edit:it has been a few weeks now and it still does this, it won't stop, I try to play song from my Playlist, but it goes and play I don't have on it, and it is just so stupid, I can't believe your famous business is failing this badly to give the user what they want.",NEGATIVE
"Can pick music I like, don't get anything don't want",NEGATIVE
Great app to listen to music on...10/10 would definitely recommend,POSITIVE
Give thousand ad one after song ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ i like that why you intrued app for ad only know why you that music change your name and set spotify play thouand ad and podcasts,NEGATIVE
This app is so nice i listen my fav song and my fav artist i follow them i like spotify so much Thank you spotify,POSITIVE
"Very excellent app, it gives me the collection of my pet music, thanx spotify.",POSITIVE
I like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that I can't choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and I can't listen to whatever I want and if I put one music in a playlist to listen to it They add music out of no where its annoying,NEGATIVE
Should also include downloading so that we could use it offline(free of cost).,NEGATIVE
"It would be great if App supports a feature to add a song as â€Play Next"". Apart from that it was Top Class.",POSITIVE
"Excellent variety of music tracks, nothing you search you can't find ! I love this app",POSITIVE
I am a collage student and i can't afford premium even after the discount and I get it that it is trying to push its customers towards buying premium but the number of ads are getting outrageous nowadays. Mocking your free user isn't going to get them buy premium it will just push them away. It has now become an app which is just insensitive towards poor people,NEGATIVE
Thumbs up for this app! Easily download any songs that I want and it's good for sharing.,POSITIVE
exelente play list and sound quality awesome ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
"Awsm app ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ It shows all lofi songs also, it's great ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ & Also unplugged album song â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",POSITIVE

Totally worth it people.ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—",POSITIVE
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.,NEGATIVE
I feel like there's a new update every other day. Whenever I got to use the app it either closes itself or just doesn't play music. Then I checked and.... surprise... another update. Sometimes I don't have the time to download the update and so I just have to be music less. So annoying.,NEGATIVE

It's a good app it has all the death metal I listen to. My only problem is why the hell do have to go offline to listen to downloaded music. And I have a 5g phone and it always says I'm offline unless I'm on WiFi and I pay for it. That's why I given one star,NEGATIVE

"Update 30/06/22 - I've been a Premium user now since October '21 and it has been an awesome ride of discovery and rediscovery across the musical spectrum for me! If you have the change, try out Spotify and you won't regret it because it's worth every penny in my view. There are plenty of lesser known artists in this that mainstream is absolutely clueless about which is good of Spotify to include in their catalogue. At Â£9.99 it's like paying for access to the biggest record collection ever!",POSITIVE
Very nice music app I love it so much ðŸ’ž,POSITIVE
"Thank you for returning back normal position of media control buttons. Please, avoid this kind of experiments in the future.",NEGATIVE

I don't like it so many ads after every one song.... This not suitable for who not purchase premium...,NEGATIVE
I enjoy this App. It has so many options and is easy to use,POSITIVE
"The app's great! Just like I heard it. Infact, it had almost all the musics and podcasts I just needed.. All I had an issue with is this - When a playing song ends, the 'notification' for the song disappears and the next song doesn't play.. I've recently updated Spotify but it doesn't work, I manually need to change the song each time one ends (Which gets annoying when we are gaming or being on Social medias). Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
"Very awesome, allows you to listen to worship music without any interuptions and still has minimal ads",POSITIVE
"As a fan of listening to Korean, Japanese and Chinese Songs, i would greatly appreciate it when you consider incorporating a ""ROMANIZED"" version to your lyrics' section esp. for those people (including me) who likes to sing along with the song/s. Please consider this for your next update. Thank you!",POSITIVE
"I'm ashamed that Spotify is bowing to the Cancel Culture. On top of that, all of the ""news"" podcasts are extremely left wing. Just tell me what's going on in the world and let me make up my own mind.",NEGATIVE
Its the best music app ever but the only thing is that i need internet to play music,NEGATIVE
"If you plan on paying to avoid ads and listen to podcasts or anything other than music, DO NOT BUY SPOTIFY. with the rising of people adding in content ads and such makes premium obsolete. They constantly try popping open some info on car mode while I'm driving which is a hazard. This app Is really really going down the drain. Just use apple music or Dropout TV. Or anything else really.",NEGATIVE
Why did my filters in Liked Songs disappeared after I reinstalled the app?,NEGATIVE
Good no glitches every song mood freshing albums and every thing that you would ever want,NEGATIVE
"This app is just superb... there is only one suggestion, when I opened this app it automatically started playing songs which I've heard last time... other than this... everything is good. I really loved that this app contains podcast... Thank you Spotify.",POSITIVE
Can't scroll through the genres and the genre selection got way worse. If this app wasn't the best one around I wouldn't even use it but that's what happens when 1 company owns virtually the whole market,NEGATIVE
I love this app . I am using this more than 2 years sound quality is awsome,NEGATIVE
it was a good app but recently like the past 2 months i cant edit or even see my playlists its so annoying and it dont even play them or my podcasts idk what happened but i really dont like it,NEGATIVE
Some songs disapear from my playlist. And NO it is not the artist removing them from Spotify library as they are still available to add manually again.,NEGATIVE
EDIT: SOUND QUALITY STILL SUCKS.,NEGATIVE
"Till you can't play offline mode,it fraud",NEGATIVE
Best music app ever,POSITIVE
"I get to listen to my favorite music but I don't wanna listen to other stuff because I know what I like to listen to, and I don't like what Spotify recomends, and the skips are limited for some dumb reason, so I either have to put up with the HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE music Spotify reccomends to me or use my skips. Spotify does not know my music tastes. (It recomends a ton of Brony stuff cause I like Someone Like Me and Ashes.)",NEGATIVE
I love your song app thank you to making this app,POSITIVE
"I like the app very much nice playlists for every mood but problem is there is no option for the recently heard songs . So ,please add the option of recently heard by the update.",NEGATIVE
Only Spotify comfort's me,POSITIVE
"Im paying for this and I still get ads. More and more. Not sure if its by the company or the podcasters, but its country specific, so its not a built-in ad. Even if its by the podcasters, you should not allow this. I hope youll fix this.",NEGATIVE
It's good it's just ads and I'm having troubles getting my Playlist,POSITIVE
Everything's fine except ads.,POSITIVE
Spotify has a podcast for everyone's taste,NEGATIVE

Love it been using Spotify for like 6 years now 10/10,POSITIVE

how to make basic fried rice 3 cups cooked rice * 2 Tbs sesame oil. 1 small white onion chopped. 1 cup frozen peas and carrots thawed. 2-3 Tablespoons soy sauce more or less to taste. 2 eggs lightly beaten. 2 Tbsp chopped green onions optional.,NEGATIVE
"Easy to use, transparent app with all music you need.",NEGATIVE
Great application to my music world,POSITIVE
"My fav app, can't do without it even for a day!",POSITIVE
Its good till you are done listening because if you want to hear the song again spotify plays some random song even if i put it on my playlist it wont play because spotify keeps adding other songs and it keeps playing them instead of the song i want and i cant find a way to stop it,NEGATIVE
Would be great if lyrics could be displayed for all songs - not necessarily Genius,NEGATIVE

Excellent app with a huge selection of music from a broad range of genres.,POSITIVE
Pls help I can NOT PLAY SELECTED SONG pls all I want is free music,NEGATIVE
Worst music and podcast app available Edit: 6/30/2022 (over a year later) This app accrossed all my devices is still absolutely horrible. If I rewind a podcast more than 15 seconds it goes into a buffering loop that never ends. On occasion if I get ads on a podcast it restarts any podcast I'm listening to then makes me listen to adds again at a random spot in the podcast. HIRE SOME ACTUAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS,NEGATIVE
UI is terrible + app doesn't even work half the time.,NEGATIVE
"Download for any particular song is not available, at home page ther is only playlists add some song too ........",NEGATIVE
Chose Spotify for the minimal user interface it has. Spotify makes syncing so easy across different OSs.,NEGATIVE
Worst application.samsung duos phone is faster than Spotify,NEGATIVE
I like it from the start but when I play my fav song and it ends it's plays random song update this pls,NEGATIVE

"It's good app for music lover ,specialty who use music when they work",POSITIVE
"I just bought premium 2 days ago and since yesterday the app just won't open. I've tried everything: force stopping the app, uninstalling then reinstalling, removing then retaining permissions. But it just stays stuck on the logo when I try to open it. I'm not having my money poured down the drain on premium for something that won't even open! Is there a way I can recover the app properly? I'm on android. Thanks.",NEGATIVE
"Used to love this app.. the 30 minutes without interruption. good times. now it's an ad every 1-2 songs. I barely use this app anymore because of it. and when it says ""30 minutes without interruption"" it's actually just 4 songs then like 10 ads straight.",NEGATIVE
I love to sing so I love this decause there are not a lot of adds and you can listen to music and not be interpreted and listen to any song the song you love.,NEGATIVE
had only no song only hard,NEGATIVE
"It's a good app for listening music but it's too restricting, when i play my fav song it automatically played another song which is not in my playlist.",NEGATIVE
"It is really awesome â¤. Like so much better than the YouTube app. When I close yt, the song or video doesn't continue playing. It's because I am a tablet user. But Spotify is really awesome. If I close it the song still plays. It even asks you for your three fav artists and it makes you a mix by yr personality. Great music platform! Tap install already now! â¤ðŸ˜ƒ",POSITIVE
Actually the pc version is good you can atleast select between the songs in your playlist and in this app you can't even do that and when i play my playlist it automatically selects shuffle and sometimes it just playes a songs that is not even in my playlist a rubbish app deleting it.,NEGATIVE
"Good app, but lots of Add",POSITIVE
Music is great even has some classics but it only lets you skip song 6 tims instead of as many times as you want and it dose not let you just listen to you're play list with out the suggested songs unless you have premium and it sucks.,NEGATIVE
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening",NEGATIVE
It is an excellent music app,POSITIVE
"I used to enjoy the app a lot more even though it's been glitchy and laggy from time to time but now I have to deal with advertisements every two songs, 3 if I'm lucky. And not just 1 or 2 ads but 3-4 ads and the same ones over and over again. So for every half an hour I listen I hear like 10+ ads and it gets old fast. When I skip a song or change channels it goes straight to ads again, so I feel stuck listening to something I don't want to so as to avoid the same ads yet again.",NEGATIVE
Worst app ever used. It has more adds than songs that we search for. Irritating adds force me to uninstall.,NEGATIVE
Great app but very annoying. I accidentally hit 'do not play again' because I wanted it to play on loop and now I cant play it no more and it really anoys me because this is the only app I can shut my phone off with,NEGATIVE
"Simply select the mood and you will be taken by it, so simple",POSITIVE
"The app is really good, but I hate how how you have to shuffle to listen to playlist and not just pick a song you want to listen to, and how many ads there are. I get 9-10 ads before I can listen to a song. Or the song just gets skipped cause of â€œInternet connectionsâ€ even though I'm connected to strong internet. Some times I hate how you need to pay for a offline playlist. Spotify is a really good app, but even though it has some pros, it has a lot more down sides to it.",NEGATIVE
Nice application for song lover.,POSITIVE
Sometimes there's an annoying bugâ€¦ It closed by itself or just stop playing,NEGATIVE
Great variety of music,POSITIVE
Great human story - great interview where the interviewer draws an amazing story from Jay Gaffey - looking forward to Pt 2,POSITIVE

Best way to hear pure way of music and huge collection,POSITIVE
Thanks for making ads unskippable out of nowhere so you f me up while traveling on the road. I will never buy anything I hear from a Spotify ad because I can't skip.,POSITIVE
Finally got Spotify Premium and it's worth it. No more annoying ads and so many features. The price is reasonable to be fair. I just love it.,POSITIVE
"Never had an app that literally ignores my imput... garbage. I search a song I want to listen to, listen to the ad then guess what... It plays sum bs not even related to the artist or song I want to hear. Okay no big deal I'll just skip it then... NOPE ANOTHER IRRELEVANT song I didn't ask for until I have no skips left and it never attempted to play the song or artist I wanted. Again... garbage",NEGATIVE
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen,NEGATIVE
"When i search for an artist and get in their profile, only 5 or 6 songs are displaying.",NEGATIVE
This app contains no songs from à®‡à®£à¯ˆà®¨à¯à®¤ à®•à¯ˆà®•à®³à¯ movie in tamil movie and many other tamil movie song,NEGATIVE
I love music and you gave it to me.... THANKS........,POSITIVE
Unable to unhide songs,NEGATIVE
"Spotify been a best platform for me,keep it up guys",POSITIVE
"So every week on my release radar, spotify keeps putting a random artist from a genre that i never listen to, but the song has one of bands i listen a lot tagged as a associated artist even though they aren't. For example the song: ""UTOPIA-Abridged"" by Harper Minta, Aer, Blu, and the odd ball Avatar. Which is a swedish heavy-death metal band...",POSITIVE
Too many commercials after first 30 minutes.,NEGATIVE
Paid for premium and I'm still getting advertising,NEGATIVE
This app is amazing for listening music,POSITIVE

Simply put.. Spotify > every other music stuff you know,POSITIVE
The commercials are atrocious.,NEGATIVE
Very happy with Spotify's music.,POSITIVE
"Excellent!!! Always my go to for sleeping, walking, meditating or just enjoying",POSITIVE
Just one suggestion: I've created my own Playlist and everything is fine but when I've shared it with my friends they aren't getting shuffle option for the playlist. Same problem I've experienced with many other Playlists. Please provide the shuffle option for all Playlists and if it's a bug then resolve it.,NEGATIVE
"Autoolay problem. I've disabled the setting, but spotify still plays songs that are suggested instead of the actual songs that are in my Playlist. I have premium though, it's just straight up dogshit. Use youtube instead.",NEGATIVE
love Spotify so much,POSITIVE
I con't find defferent -defferent language songs on this app:::,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify it's great music all the time anywhere i go i got my music very easy to use just add the songs you love and start listening,POSITIVE
Awesome sound quality...,POSITIVE
App is very very nice song,POSITIVE
Awesome music application,POSITIVE
"Recommend songs when I play my liked songs jeez, all I want to do is listen to my liked songs, not recommend useless songs.",POSITIVE
Way too many ads,NEGATIVE
"Wonderful, until the layout changes randomly, removes my ability to see the queue, or stops showing what music I'm playing. Acts up a bunch. I have auto-updates on, too :/",NEGATIVE
"Music is my life, and i honestly don't know where I'd be without it. I've downloaded so many apps to stream music but none of those apps come anywhere close to being as good as Spotify. Not only does it have any and every artist album and song you could think of but Spotify is always looking to find ways to keep the consumers happy and satisfied.",NEGATIVE
It's ok but I wish there was an option for them to recommend music in you playlist I wish you could turn it on or off,POSITIVE
The best music app ever,POSITIVE
"It has been a corner stone in my phone, at least now I have something that can ease up the tension. Spotiy is really an amazing app which I'll recommend to every person that passes an eye through it; don't hesitate to download it and give it a shot.",POSITIVE
Too much ad cant tolerable,NEGATIVE
I found all my related songs at one place. Recommended.,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify it is worth every penny. I like that I can take my music everywhere I got with no enteruptions. You can find all kinds of stuff in the app to, not just music.",POSITIVE
I'm getting fed up with Spotify. Even though I have almost 2000 liked songs it plays the same hundred or so when on shuffle. To the point where I end up unliking some of my favorite songs so they don't get over played. I want a shuffle option where songs are not repeated until all songs have been played. And it should be able to keep track of what's been played over multiple days. Also wish the algorithm could recognize a genre I play infrequently and not change my recommendations.,NEGATIVE
It has a lot of choices but it will pause my song mid way through or restart it.,NEGATIVE
Very large selection of music I like being able to select albums,POSITIVE
"Updating Spotify is risky. With the last few iterations, podcast downloads take forever because they keep restarting from 0%",NEGATIVE
It was a good experience having spotify. It gives a lot of energy and hype when I have it and it makes me more love music because somehow it is my comfort care for myself. All in all its very good.,POSITIVE
I love this app except for the fact that there are constant ads. I know that's just a way for the developers to get people to buy premium but it's just infuriating.,NEGATIVE
"Every song is available, & best interface among others.",POSITIVE
"I have been using the app since 5 years now, and frankly, it is a good app. But these days there are many problems with the app. Though I have purchased the premium package, I am not able to listen to the songs I want, or search for any song. It says something went wrong, or no internet connection. I waited for more than a year for the issue to get fixed. If this continues, I dont think I will renew my premium package anymore. There is no point since I cant listen to any songs.",NEGATIVE
Only plays shuffle. Spotify sux,NEGATIVE
Good buffet of songs.,POSITIVE
The app has been working for me sense 2019 and its pretty good but unfortunately when i go to daily mix it shuffles the playlists with songs that arent in that mix and yes i refreshed and swiped off the app and reopening it but it still stayed on shuffle mode even if i reinstalled it its still on shuffle so i don't know if its an update or a unfixable glitch,NEGATIVE
too bad cant play songs bad update,NEGATIVE
Love listening to the music but when I get 6 ads IN A ROW I kinda get irritated,NEGATIVE
I WANT TO SKIP AND LISTEN BUT THE OPTION IS LIMITED OTHER THAN THAT I L9VE IT,NEGATIVE
good and very easy to used app,POSITIVE
Everything is great... no doubt...but Why do uh always show ads after saying no ads for 30 minutes ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"Editing playlists, making playlists, and even playing songs are a chore using this app. The ui can use alot of work, and the fact that so many necessary features are locked behind premium make it so much more aggravating. The only reason I still use this app are the huge library of songs it contains",NEGATIVE
Very bad I got continuously 4 ads ...ðŸ˜¢ Around 1 min there must be some limit on ads you can't show it however you want I only listen music on Spotify. But this disappoints me.ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,NEGATIVE
I forgot my password and Google didn't save it. I tried to reset it and it doesn't work. If paying for it I shouldn't have sny problem with resetting a new password,NEGATIVE
It is an amazing appðŸ˜Ž .....ðŸ¤”first you download then you can seeðŸ¤« how the app is working......ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE

More ads than songs If you want to experience all types of advertisements more than songs just download without premium...if you want more songs than ads then go for Jio saavn,NEGATIVE
Feature are very friendly quality is best,POSITIVE
"I have had Spotify for a week so far its excellent, plays all the good music l want to hear.",POSITIVE
My problem is that i chose a song and it sends me to another song I don't want and i am pretty sure that is for premium but seriosly premium to stop shuffling,NEGATIVE
I wish that you could choose whether or not you want spotify to add to your playlists... I personally hate it... I made the playlist with certain songs in it... I don't need more songs added... maybe you could recommend those songs to be added but you just adding them makes my playlists useless and there was no point in me making it if you were just going to change it,NEGATIVE
Love using Spotify it's just I hateeeee the ads but I don't wanna have to pay just to get rid of them other than that I love everything about it.,POSITIVE
Good music app but worst irritating adds Avery song play after add comes,NEGATIVE

A idea for Spotify: Imagine being able to choose the years of your favorite singers activities and just listen to the period of songs produced in those years. I hope can see this option soon in the Spotify,POSITIVE

A good repotire of musicians. Great!,POSITIVE

"Very happy with Spotify so far,I'm a new user,really like the service ðŸ‘",POSITIVE

To many ads hate it although listening to music is that I love is great just calm down with the ads I be on YouTube to listen to my music if I get annoyed with the ads,NEGATIVE

"Didnt care for Spotify at 1st.. BUT ONCE I learned how it worked I FREAKING LOVED IT!! I love how it somewhat ""Learns"" the user & makes Playlist for the user on a day to day basis. It also keeps you up to date with other songs new & old! DEFINITELY WORTH DOWNLOADING! I also like how you can use Spotify & also do other things on your device without it ever Interrupting your JAMZ! Oh yeah, also if you have Premium, you can download music and use even when you have ""No Service* #UseItDaily",POSITIVE
Excellent app! You can make your own playlist of your favorite singer!,POSITIVE
"Doesn't have everything I was looking for, but it has way more than I was expecting.",POSITIVE
Not working properly,NEGATIVE

"I LOVE spotify! I very rarely have any problems but I'm seriously getting annoyed since the last update. The app will open to a black screen with the symbol and stay there. I have tried all the tips on the user community. Including batter optimizing settings, permissions and a clean reinstall and still will not work. Please help! I pay the ridiculous fee for premium family. I don't want to cancel my subscription and move to something else. I will change my review when fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing, just amazing.",POSITIVE
UI issues are back in full force,POSITIVE
This is the best the only problem I had with it it is when I like I want to listen to a song like what I'm doing the dishes or something you don't need to know sometimes it would disconnect from my headset but other than that it's fine I love it,POSITIVE
Love that they have any music that you want to here. I couldn't do without my play list,POSITIVE
Premium too expensive.,NEGATIVE
Unusable without premium. Feels like a version of Itunes from 2004 with how primitive it is without premium. Don't waste your time.,NEGATIVE
Love this app. I love controlling my TV. It's just frustrating sometimes to edit Playlist from the phone.,NEGATIVE
"Every time I restart the phone it changes my storage location from sd card to internal and starts redownloading. Highly annoying. Edit: Reduced review to 1 star, since they won't fix it.",NEGATIVE

Keeps pausing randomly for no reason,NEGATIVE
Good and easy to use,POSITIVE
Loving every moment listing to my favourite music ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
"It works really good when I listen to it through my head band and through my tablet. Even when I am in an area with no wifi, it still works great. (This is me a little bit after this review) I don't know what happened, but a band called night shift productivity is no where on Spotify anymore. Even the songs I had are gone. I don't know if this is your fault Spotify, but I'm giving you a 1 star review.",POSITIVE
The music is phenomenal!!!,POSITIVE
Not sure what is going on but automatic opening is aggravating...THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP... ANNOYEDâ€¼ï¸,NEGATIVE
"Love this app, listen to all my music on here great playlists .....Recommend to anyone !",POSITIVE
"No problems , great app",POSITIVE
"If you love music, you'll love Spotify",POSITIVE
This is rubbish can't even listen the song u choose this deserve 0 starts,NEGATIVE
"For years I used to love me some Spotify. Now it's infuriating. I can't even control to the point where I can't even skip songs, go back, choose playlists. It says I'm offline when I'm sitting next to my high speed router. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling now. Not optimistic. Update: All good, problem solved",NEGATIVE
"20220629 Update... still sucks. Have to unistiall, reinstall app often. Stops playing very frequently, can't use lock screen controls.",NEGATIVE
Genre tab in liked music is broken,NEGATIVE
Amazing interface and very easy to use.,POSITIVE
"I think Spotify is a high-quality app and if you are looking for a high-quality music app this is the one. you can like songs, make playlists and enjoy. P.S follow me on Spotify",POSITIVE
I cant play the music i want because it is on shuffling and i had to re-download it and it is still doing the same thing. And now i dont know what to do,NEGATIVE
"It's just barely not 5 stars, there are often technical issues and if you miss a payment by a few days they'll take the downloaded music off your phone with no warning. Otherwise no other music app is like it",NEGATIVE
They ruined it you can only skip 6 times and you can't even see what song is going to play next!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
I never expected to find greatest music ðŸŽ¶! Thank,POSITIVE
"Love love love. My favorite app for music. I have a recommendation or two. It would be super cool if you could create easier ways to organize music to playlists. Like creating four boxes that you can personalize. One for podcasts, for artists, for songs, etc. Something where you could add playlists in. It would also be awesome if there was a + you could click on when you want to add a song to a playlist(or playlists) while on the lock screen. Thankss",POSITIVE
So far so good. I've never had a problem or complaint with this app.,POSITIVE
Almost each and every song I can think of is here.,POSITIVE
"Fantastic,amazing selection of all typs of music",POSITIVE
This is the best music app ever,POSITIVE
Great app but I don't want shuffle to repeat songs in a playlist till the whole playlist has been played.,NEGATIVE
"I have to say. I do love spotify. Never been bothered to give an app a rating, unless it was rubbish. But Spotify is great.",POSITIVE
App never works right. I pay for premium and still get ads.,NEGATIVE
The app likes to randomly stop and close when using. It would be great otherwise. 2 stats since it constantly closes on me everyday throughout the day.,POSITIVE
Oh my goodness it is really nice cz you get every music you want ðŸ¤ðŸ¤,POSITIVE
I had a very good experience until now but Spotify robbed my money when I paid for the premium subscription and I didn't get the premium account activated after the successful payment and I still haven't received my refund back all they say is that they didn't receive the payment which was successfully from my side. Don't subscribe for premium with UPI they will rob you.,NEGATIVE
Great app especially for podcasts. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it can be very very slow sometimes.,NEGATIVE
"I hope this app fixes itself because I am really not happy with the results. In the free plan, you get SIX skips an hour. Which means you have to sit through songs you hate or dont want to here at the time. You cant pick a song and play it, which is really bad for picking a song you want to watch. And one of the most annoying things is that it will ADD RANDOM SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLISTS. THIS DOES NOT WORK. HOW BSREBONES CAN YOU EVEN KEEP A FREE VERSION. Never spend a penny on this app. Use audity.",NEGATIVE
If I'm paying for Ad free it should apply to podcasts too.,NEGATIVE
Great app clear and crisp sound ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Please allow premium subscription to be paid by Google Play Store balance as it is in other apps.,NEGATIVE
"App was fine until I purchased premium membership. Free version shoes ads after every 30 minutes which is okay but when I purchased Premium subscription for a day to try premium, ads popped up after every 2 songs which was like 5-7 minutes. At first I thought it'd be a glitch but even after relaunching the app same thing happened which spoiled party ridiculously. I am glad I din't purchase monthly or yearly package. Whoever thinking to buy premium membership, DON'T GO FOR IT AT ALL. TRY GAANA.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify I can find old country music that I grew up listening to. My parents were musicians. I'm a die hard old country music fan. Don't like the new stuff. I'm 80 yrs old. I Absolutely love Waylon Jennings forever. He's the Man along with Willie Nelson. I love all old country NOT the new stuff!,POSITIVE
"App is a Memory HOG. It runs slow on all devices. No ability it ""Down rate anything"". This is balanced by search Anything and find. App has changed it's shape a few times and NO option to use a different layout.",NEGATIVE
*edit: so many features are broken and don't work. Getting worse Great except the podcast player is not as good as others (deleting downloads already listened to/sorting) Recently offline mode is horrible to use. Songs and I have downloaded won't play/are greyed out and say internet is not available. If I reconnect to wifi all my downloads become available next time I disconnect. A day without internet will cut my downloads out. Very frustrating when cellular data or internet is not easy to get.,NEGATIVE
"Great Stufft It's, my kind of music so far keep rocking.",POSITIVE
My premium doesnt work and i tried everything already but it wont work.,POSITIVE
Disappearing controls are making this app unusable. It also ignores my setting to not resume playing automatically (I NEVER WANT THIS-- WHO DOES?!) I've been waiting for over a year for these to be fixed and nothing. Another android dev team failing to bother testing their own app!,NEGATIVE
They provide good quality music and entertainment.,POSITIVE
"You give me 3 unskippable ads and then play songs that aren't even in my playlist, CONSECUTIVELY. I used all my skips and never even got to any of the songs that WERE in my playlist. Seriously? Why should I subscribe when this is the BS I get?",NEGATIVE
Awesome app love it to bits...,POSITIVE
the music i like it.,POSITIVE
Love commercials? Love hearing a short ad that will allow 30 minutes of commercial free music? Too bad!!! The commercial never ends!! Turn it off and reopen? Wrong!! Same commercial!!!!! Gets worse everytime I use it!!! Do not use!!!!,NEGATIVE
App functions well on both phone and chromebook,POSITIVE
Amazing app â¤ï¸ I loved it this is so good for songs thank you for this amazing app I'm happy â¤ï¸ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Idk what's going on but I like this song called ""gverment hooker (sped up) "" and whenever I try to play it, it either says ""song is not available "" or it just skips to the next song on my playlist. Fix this please.",NEGATIVE
"I listened to a podcast with Nancy Grace, I've missed her, she's on a different channel now. Still a great speaker and trying to put killers behind bars for years.",NEGATIVE
"Good app runs smooth, thanks for your service Spotify.",POSITIVE
I like it better then YouTube premium it keeps your music and not have to redownload your music every couple of days.,POSITIVE
It's is wonderful to have access to music at anytime and by your favourite artist. It is so clear and great. Just completely love it.,POSITIVE
"Your is broken, I can't like songs anymore please fix it",NEGATIVE
"It's an amazing experience to have majority songs on a music platform - online and offline both! However, it would be great if Spotify could take suggestions for missing songs, which users would like to be made available.",POSITIVE
I can search any Playlist with less internet,NEGATIVE
I like the quality of songs,POSITIVE
I'm unable to login to the app at all. I keep getting the message something went wrong try again. I'm currently in my 15th try.,NEGATIVE
"The app is great but there are some problems, some really famous songs are not included such as still with you of jungkook and there is another problem that of u wanna read lyrics of a song it comes is in the samee language as the song for example if u wanna listen to a Korean song the lyrics will be in Korean and u can't translate it into English but other then that it's a great app and I definitely recommend it I hope my advice helped byeeee",POSITIVE
"When they roll out the HI-RES Audio option they will get 5 stars, before than it's just 3.",NEGATIVE
Great app tons of music,POSITIVE
I love using this app just I want to close the app tab and play the music but otherwise l love it its great it has podcasts and plenty of music and its not to hard to find a song they also reccommend good songs for you its really nice! 10/10,POSITIVE
The got rid of the slide to queue song option for literally no reason,NEGATIVE
"Accidentally deleted my old review. I have been a Premium user since day one. Last year (21) Spotify had some serious issues, but it's back on track. Spotify remains the best music streaming platform.",POSITIVE
I found my favorite songs and bands,POSITIVE
Listen to it every day almost all night long if I could best music app ever,NEGATIVE
"There are a number of features I like, they include: 1) Replaying a song you like without having to listen to ads. 2) Synchronized highlighting of lyrics. 3) Including lessor known singers while listening to a genre like ""Classic Rock"". 4) I love the fact Spotify works outside the US unlike some other streaming services. 5) When you select an specific group the suggested groups you might like are very nicely curated!",POSITIVE
The only reason why I give it 4 and not 5 is because it adds to many songs to my playlist and it doesn't give me enough skips to skip them so I get stuck listening to songs that I don't like and that I never even heard,NEGATIVE
Love this app I play music almost every minute of the day,POSITIVE
Wow! nice but I can't download any music,NEGATIVE
"App has suddenly become horribly unstable. Frequently, a new song will start, but the notification won't update. When this happens, the app will only open as a black screen and the only way to stop music is to force stop the app. Have tried all the usual troubleshooting, cleared data, reinstalled, etc. but this still happens almost every time i listen to music with the app.",NEGATIVE
The best app ever I would totally recommend it to a lot of people love you Spotify,POSITIVE
"I'm not sure if it's just my app but it's beyond a joke now. My friends say they get 1 or 2 ads in between songs when I get 4+, I've even had 7 ads in a row!! Please fix this, it's incredibly annoying and I don't have the money for premium",NEGATIVE
Been trying tp get the premium pack but neither the system let me do it.1,NEGATIVE
The app has all the original version of the songs,NEGATIVE
Great app with a very good sound quality. Works great with my voice assistant too which is a bonus,POSITIVE
"I hear my friends talking about spotify , how good it is this app to listen any kind of music , I'm a Salsa music fan and you didn't hear this music in the radio station anymore .so I download this app and I'm so happy to play anytime the Salsa music that I love to hear !!!",POSITIVE
Love spotify. Only change I'd have is to be able to reorder my playlists easily. I've added whole albums to my playlist before but don't want them to be all in a row. If there was a way to permanently shuffle the list that would be awesome!!,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is nice and all but when ever I try to play a song I want to play it plays another song that is similar to the one I want to hear, I never get to listen to the actual songs I want to listen to and it's kind of annoying",NEGATIVE
Pretty easy to use and organized UI/UX,NEGATIVE
Only problem i've encountered that actually bothers me is the cut down lyrics. A lot of songs have missing words and that kinda sucks.,NEGATIVE
showing break after a every song because u want that users take your premium account by getting frustrated of seeing ads. Worst app!! They interupt after every song by showing ads and say after every ad enjoy the next 30 minutes without interuption ðŸ¤¯,NEGATIVE
There are numerous stability issues with the app in June 2022.,NEGATIVE
This is the worst app that I have ever used. I can hear ads after playing 2 to 3 songs even though we don't want to buy the premium the ads are increasing day by day and I am sure that this strategy will lose a lot of customers and I am sure that you have got 4.3 ratings and it is going to turn into 3 very soon,NEGATIVE
It's so good These are all song which you want,POSITIVE
Controls keep disappearing so I can't stop music or podcasts without forcing the app to stop. Happens again I'll switch.,NEGATIVE
Vvvv poor. Soo much ads. Didn't liked much. Mood spoiler ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
"one word, Fantastic.",POSITIVE
It's a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,POSITIVE
If you are a free user you can't skip a song after 6 songs??? I get it for the other features but skipping a song? Nop,NEGATIVE
Great app for listening music ðŸŽ¶.,POSITIVE
One of the Splendid Musical Apps as I luv to read the lyrics along with the song.,POSITIVE
I love â¤ï¸ Spotify music and the GREATEST OF Jo ROGAN PODCASTER,POSITIVE
The last month this app has progressively gotten worse. After the last attempt to uninstall/reinstall all of my playlists are empty and I get a message saying there isnt internet connection and to try again. So frustrating since I'm paying for the premium.,NEGATIVE
It doesn't allow me to log in it says im abroad and shouldn't change my location even after i do so it doesn't allow me in i will change jt when when it start working,NEGATIVE
"Controls to pause, skip track, etc have disappeared for days. Killing the app was a fix but that has stopped working.",NEGATIVE
"lately I've been having A LOT of problems with spotify. the songs just won't play normally, it pauses every 10 seconds without explanation. and it's been happening on the desktop version too. please fix it, it's really annoying.",NEGATIVE
My everyday music app. Has a large database of songs compared to Prime Music.,POSITIVE
Ads and limited skips??? Come on Spotify. You are going to lose customers now. The reason I left Pandora was the ads and skip limits!! NOT HAPPY!!,NEGATIVE
"Love the app , although they shud let rhe ppl online have a lil more accessible option",POSITIVE
I love how I can turn off the screen and still listen. My only complaint is how it will play the next newer podcast file rather than go down the list.. it would be nice if there was an option to autoplay in either direction on the list,NEGATIVE
Not work in my mobile properly just useless,NEGATIVE
Why so many ads in every 2 songs. They say one ads for 30 min whts going on this app Too many ads worst app,NEGATIVE
Why can't you choose your own songs? It'll make it simpler and give people more freedom.,POSITIVE
"Loved Spotify premium when I had it, but as soon as I couldn't afford it I was booted to free Spotify, and I never realized how absolutely awful it is. Limited skips and the inability to pick a song or make a queue is maddening. As someone with ADHD, I need this ability because I often need specific songs for certain activities. But no, that is now impossible because I am poor. Thanks for making me feel worse about it, Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Spotify just gives a wonderful experience to music,POSITIVE
I love the app. I do wish there was a way to remove songs from the recommended section at the bottom of the playlist that way you could get new recommendations without having to hit refresh a bunch of times.,POSITIVE
It's alright best to get a subscription to enjoy all features. It's still good when free too.,POSITIVE
I just love having access to all types of songs that speak to my current situations. Love being able to download and listen even when I'm away from home. My alarm is linked to Spotify and my mornings start with the best melodies,POSITIVE
"This app is actually very useful for , like the songs that I don't have , they have it here and I can play one of my favourite songs even though I don't have the song. But the problem is that I don't always have data . For once can't there be a good app that doesn't have to use up data or WI-FI. Like really we don't ( I don't ) have the money to buy data every time I need to come on Spotify . Thank you .",NEGATIVE
I am not able to open Spotify it just freezes when I try to open it on the main screen I can't listen to songs ðŸ˜­ HELP!!!,NEGATIVE
Would've been 5 star but the shuffle music isnt needed I'm trying to listen to specific song instead it plays a different song,NEGATIVE
Great app easy to listen and share music,POSITIVE
I'm using first time this music app it's amazing music collection. Thanks for the making app,POSITIVE
"I've been using this app for years and only recently decided to upgrade to premium. I was very excited with all the perks you get. The only downside to it however, is that for some reason I'm still getting adds whenever I listen to podcasts? Which I don't really understand? Because, you know, I'm PAYING for NO ads? I mean I can understand when you get adds from the person you're listening to cuz they're built into the audio. But I've heard the SAME adds in multiple podcasts. Kinda dumb right?ðŸ˜‘",NEGATIVE
"I hate everything about this app, the most user-friendly app I have ever purchased. Day one and I can not cancel it fast enough.",NEGATIVE
Love it! Easy and everything I love,POSITIVE
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.,POSITIVE
"Great app, it's my go to for music.",POSITIVE
"I'm glad I can listen to my favourite podcasts but this whole you have to pay all of a sudden to listen to a song you like, that is not worth it, i suggest you take a step down with the latest update",NEGATIVE
Just able to here some Playlist of certain artist and Era.,POSITIVE
"Literally , Spotify is awesome ðŸ‘ŒðŸ» ðŸ‘ .Just love it ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜ â¤ï¸",POSITIVE
Good musical app obviously.But should be care about bengali songs.Not sufficient collection.,NEGATIVE
New experience. Still getting to grips with options,POSITIVE
1 Star because in after every songs advertisement started.. this is very bad idea... Please change this... Then it will be Better One all other apps... Thank you..,NEGATIVE
"every time I want to open an mp3 file on my cellphone, it opens with the Spotify application. is there no option to stop it? please remove that ASAP.",NEGATIVE
"I love this app! Found musiÃ§ that I've been looking for for years - and compiled playlists according to my tastes. Easy to use, even for me.....somewhat elderly, to put it politely. I recommend this app.",POSITIVE
"Google Home speaker volumes never stay at what I set them to when playing via Spotify. Set the volume from Spotify and it resets one speaker (but not the other) back down to ~25%, when I didn't ask it to do that, even if I was turning the volume UP it still resets it down. It's really annoying and it needs to be fixed.",NEGATIVE
"All good...try making some daily mix according to various moods intead of same playlists ....and adds making experience annoying at some moments..except for this, all else is fine !!!",POSITIVE
On playstation ads freeze up the app and it has to be restarted once a week of not more. On my phone I have to force close the app or else it will stay open in the background.,NEGATIVE
"This is a great application, but you could have made settings to translate song lyrics to any language",NEGATIVE
"This app just stopped working.....uninstalled numerous times, reset the cell, cleared the cache and still not working...family premium member and I can't use it! Very frustrating!!!!!!",NEGATIVE
"Spotify have always been my go-to music streaming platform, but for awhile now does it consistently happen that the media control buttons doesn't appear in app or in notifications. I've tried to clear the app cache and tried to reinstall the app but nothing seems to work",NEGATIVE
i like using spotify because i find all my favorite songs in it and other things that may please everyone but the only problem is that it needs wifi and you can't skip just 5 times per hour ..but i still like it,POSITIVE
This app was good before not now cus this is not performing well with my phone it crashes frequently and shows ' no internet connection ' even though it is connected. It's kinda disappointed with Spotify,NEGATIVE
Absolutely ðŸ’¯ % fantastic for music of any genre looking forward to the moment I move to premium.,POSITIVE
Group session is not working even when I'm on premium,NEGATIVE
This is the best app for songs I ever had ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"The best app ever, I got a collection of music from AC/DC to Zebra and over 50 playlist on file... Spotify Your The Best, forget the rest... 2021-2022 and still going strong... Shut-Up Randy",POSITIVE
This is a great app to use for listening to music for free! The only problem is sometimes I'll get like 5 ads in a row. But otherwise 10/10 recommend!,POSITIVE
"spotify on chromebook is awful, i genuinely dont understand why it is so bad. the app shuts down almost every hour, the music is laggy and you cannot see friends activity. i really hope they improve the app because it honestly ruins my music listening experience while i work on my chromebook",NEGATIVE
Very good music but premium is a bit pricey,POSITIVE
I have downloaded the Spotify app on my Android phone and it gets stuck at the Spotify logo. I've restarted my phone a few times. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've forced stop the app and restart it again. I'm connected to the internet. Nothing works. It remained stuck at the Spotify logo.,NEGATIVE
This app sucks. It is the worst. I have tried managing it but it just isn't worth it. Don't install the app especially if you have a Samsung. It doesn't allow you to fast forward the music. It also doesn't let you to go back to a previous song or go to the next song for free. I hate this god damn appðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡. It f ing sucks ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡.,NEGATIVE
"You know, ive had this app for a couple years now. I even PAID FOR PREMIUM. IT DOES NO GOOD. ON -ROKU- THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THEIR APP TO PLAY MORE THAN 10 MINUTES WITHOUT FREEZING!!! YOU HAVE ONLY 1 JOB, PEOPLE. LITTLE CHANNELS PRODUCED IN GRANDMAS BASEMENT CAN RUN SEEMLESSLY ON -ROKU- WHY CANT YOU?",NEGATIVE
My type of songs. Love them. Thank youðŸŒº,POSITIVE
Just love all the great music choices!!!,POSITIVE
Changed my previous back to 5 stars. The ability to preview songs before adding them to your playlist is back. Back to being my favorite music app :),NEGATIVE
I like it but I have one problem that is the extra songs I hate it when my favorite songs end one of the extra songs starts to play plz delete it,NEGATIVE
"Filled with ads, they basically make u desperate to buy premium, and even after they give an ad which gives us 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, one song later, there is a new ad!!",NEGATIVE
It is a very good app. It has all the music you need. So you should all try it,POSITIVE
"bring back the ability to play and shuffle at the same time or i'm canceling my premium. this is ridiculous, who asked for that to go away?",NEGATIVE
Found everything i wanted in this app I'm going premium very affordable,POSITIVE
Donâ€™t download this app this app is trying is best to make it hard to listen songs. Hate suffle ðŸ¤¬ Just try mod apk its great or buy premium donâ€™t be a foolðŸ˜˜,NEGATIVE
Spotify is better than other apps its doesn't stuck Which is pretty good but one thing you can bring is some more songs maybe cuz i didn't find much Chinese popular songs not only Chinese you may add some others too that is my suggestions,NEGATIVE
"The app sucks. I pay for dual membership and it constantly stops on its own for no reason, not connected to anything. The play bar disappears and the only way to pause it is to close the app entirely. It constantly rewinds itself 10 seconds when playing podcasts. And it's not just my phone it's my husband's too. Both are fairly new phones. It's ridiculous to pay for a service as much as we do and they can't even get the app to work properly. And I do have auto updates turned on.",NEGATIVE
2 stars due to lagging play a song allgood 2nd song comes on plays for about 20sec then cuts off everytime. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fix the problem and nothing still the same and I'm a premium customer this use to be one of the best apps.. what's going on Spotify paid customer to get ripped off not cool. If not fixed uninstalling for good take my $$ somewhere else.,POSITIVE
I'd rather use YouTube/ YouTube music. At least it gives you enough features while having the ads. Spotify doesn't even play some songs if you don't have a subscription,NEGATIVE
Can't think of a better music app but only thing is I've been having trouble with bugs for a few days now.. so requesting u to fix those bugs and the rest is fine Ps- I'll change my review once the bugs r fixed,NEGATIVE
"They blatantly lie about the free version, making me distrust them so much I won't uograde to premium. They claim that fewer than 15 tracks on a playlist in free mode means they'll add songs to the playlist. I have >20 & they keep adding tracks, including tracks I already hid. Plus, they are STILL one of the worst in paying artists, so I'll continue to pay Apple Music despite its glitches (pays almost double). App's also not intuitive, and I won't pay extra for something misleading and greedy.",NEGATIVE
"Best music streaming app I have used. **After a few years, I still agree. I used Pandora, and have access to it free w/ TMobile, have used IHeart and others. My experience w/ Spotify does not falter.",POSITIVE
It is amazing and so much fun to listen the song back to back with spotify I loved this app,POSITIVE
"New updates brought a ""Allow Bluetooth"" screen to popup everytime I open the app. Not sure why it keeps asking permissions for things it already has and might actively be using",NEGATIVE
Always interrupts ads,NEGATIVE
"Developer's, You collect to much of my personal info, then it states I can delete all of my personal info. I can't delete mine! I just turned phone on. Spotify was playing a show when I didn't turn Spotify on. I uninstalled the application. I want my personal information Deleted! Please fix this. I don't know what Android wear is, but that's the 1st question.",NEGATIVE
Apart from having to pay Â£10 because that all I can afford to get ad free music is PERFECT! Thx,POSITIVE
"Fix Android Auto integration. Performance is poor and interface is terrible. Menus are very poorly thought-out, recently played is never up to date and playlists are difficult to search.",NEGATIVE
The last update of Spotify is totally sucks. I can't played all my favorites music anymore if im offline and all my downloaded playlist is totally gone. What happened Spotify fixed all the bug and changes and all the mess you done. And its restricted the plan even you pay premium. Please back the old update. I loved the application but this is very disappointed and frustrating. Im using Spotify from the start and paying premium every monthly.,NEGATIVE
It's really good app because in the traveling we can listen many playlist...,POSITIVE
"Premium is Best , plain is full of Add",POSITIVE
To many advertisement!!!,NEGATIVE
I've used it for years. Even without premium there aren't many ads so it's ok to listen without it.,POSITIVE
Always have music on so use Spotify and stream it through house.,NEGATIVE
Love no ads!,NEGATIVE
"The app will NOT work. Just a black screen with spotify icon. Have cleared cache and data, logged out, reinstalled, restarted device. No purported solutions work!! So frustrating. Support is garbage as well. Chat support has you do the abovementioned over and over with same results...Einstein's definition. Premium is a cimolete ripoff if it won't work on mobile devices!!!!",NEGATIVE
"Free listeners get about a minute and a half of ads every two songs. It's crazy excessive. And you're forced to listen to you're playlist on shuffle. You can't pick what song you want to listen to, or listen to your playlist straight through. I know they want you to buy Spotify Premium, but ruining the free experience is not the way to do it",NEGATIVE
"If you want to be a free listener, then don't get it. You have limited skips and you can't pick the songs you want. I would recommend Pandora.",NEGATIVE
I dont know why the app is stuck right now. It does not open. Its for the first time since i am using. I have reinstalled it twice but nothing changed. It was ok before but idk what has happened. Plz guide me!!,NEGATIVE
User interface isn't customizable and Spotify doesn't care what their users want. Another company that doesn't respect their paid users.,NEGATIVE
"Its Great app, No complaint so far.",POSITIVE
6/29 Update - STILL Constantly deletes downloaded songs. All the time it just deletes the entire library.,NEGATIVE
"I downloaded this app, started using it,it was fun but after few days, songs I liked ain't playing anymore.",NEGATIVE
I love how I can edit playlist and everything in the app. Can we be able to move the playlist thenselves in the order we like without having to go to PC please. Thank you.,POSITIVE
Really great app with loads of feature in their premiums.,POSITIVE
Really 5minutes of adds???ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ Sometimes even more than 5mins and just to get 30minutes add free? ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
"Like the app but it's become buggy lately! It doesn't run in the background consistently when the phone is locked (even though it has the permission) also sometimes it takes too long for it to load the song, even on high speed internet. My phone is Google Pixel 3a. ******** Update in summer 2022: The problem is solved. Thanks!",NEGATIVE
It was great to have something that works it was great to have something that works oh I said that twice,POSITIVE

"Great algorithm, loving the app.",POSITIVE
"Easy to use, sound is okay. They took away, for free users, the ability to pick a song from an album and add it to a Playlist. They wouldn't let you listen to it, which is fair, but atleast you could add it to a Playlist and enjoy later. Now all you can do is shuffle a artist and hope you get the song you want.",POSITIVE
So easy to use and it is awsome app.,NEGATIVE
Awesome...has tons of song options and almost always has the songs I'm looking for!! Highly recommend this app to everyone.,POSITIVE
"Does have the library it boasts. Gotta restart it sometimes, but I look forward to them fixing this. Good deal.",POSITIVE
I really enjoy as it is ad free.,POSITIVE
Glitchiest POS app i have on my phone but great music selection.,POSITIVE
Insanely great app for listening to musics of your choice,POSITIVE
Great experience I like music collection and sound quality,POSITIVE
Spotify is more difficult to work than other similar platform but one's you get the hang of it it's all good from there Scotty boy ðŸ’¯ Spotify playlist check me out ðŸŽ§ðŸ’¯ plus if I make a playlist up I want to play it in the order that I set it up on its on shuffle and it's a pain when I'm trying to show my skills to the public what goes with what track after another in a selective way like it should be done by Scotty boy ðŸ’¯ Spotify playlist ðŸŽ§,NEGATIVE
Its good but the random thing makes me hate it at times,NEGATIVE
"Love it...no complaints. Love the customization, the ability to one particular song, and listening to an artist station that only plays THAT ARTIST and not similar ones too.",POSITIVE
"Love it!!!!!!! Music old and new, podcasts, make and share playlists.",POSITIVE
Love the variety and so easy to use!,POSITIVE
The best music app I have ever used in my life Offers great sound quality ðŸ”¥,POSITIVE
It glitches when my phone screen turns off and won't playðŸ˜ ,NEGATIVE
I love music . Nice experience,POSITIVE
I love the app I would give it 4 stars but it keeps on playing suggested songs and I don't know how to take them of.,NEGATIVE
only down side is that u cant download music offline,NEGATIVE
Always a great selection of music. Never disappointed ðŸ˜‰ It's my go to daily,POSITIVE
Only 4 stars because there will always be room for improvement.,NEGATIVE
Besides the free music. It has terrible navigation. I cant play a specific song from a playlist. Either that or the features are well hidden,NEGATIVE
"So far so good! Just getting it, so I haven't explored through it yet.",POSITIVE
Good but wish it was better the fact that u can't pick the exact song u want to play but u have to wait and the ads are a problem if ur not paying for the premium.,NEGATIVE
I listen to it every day. Lots of options for us podcast junkies,NEGATIVE
"I hate the recent changes to the ""My Library"" section of the app. Bad design choice. Please revert back. -6/7/2021 That was my last review. Now I'm going back and reducing my rating even further because the quality of service from Spotify and their application has gotten worse. I pay for Spotify premium to have an ad free listening experience. Spotify is now inserting ads into podcasts that already have integrated sponsorships, even for premium users. 1 star.",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify. I especially like how Spotify exposes me to music that I would normally never hear on commercial radio. Totally recommend,POSITIVE
This device is too slow and too demanding. There's s lot of features that complicate it's use. Spotify does not work at all.,NEGATIVE
Amazing! Almost every day at every hour I listen to music and Spotify gives me a lot of opportunities to keep listening my favorite jams and podcast.,POSITIVE
Sound should be increased to best experience,NEGATIVE
Good library to choose from.,POSITIVE
"Autoplay is frustrating. I hate when I connect to any of my Bluetooth devices, Spotify immediately starts playing. I'll pick what I want to play on my device, thank you.",NEGATIVE
I just love Spotify. I never go a day without it!,POSITIVE
"Love it, simple to use, but effective!",POSITIVE
"Such a wonderful app, but it contains adds after each song. This is the only demerit in this app. Other features are awesome.",POSITIVE
I like the app so far. I should take the time to make more playlist.,NEGATIVE
High quality of sound,POSITIVE
"This app annoyed me too much, come on!! Ads after every single music?? Why why why??? And I'm not a billionaire to get premium account...",NEGATIVE
All your music needs in one place,NEGATIVE
I can hear all my favourite songs,POSITIVE
"I used to love this app. It had a very large selection of music and podcasts, but over the years I've used this, the ad amount has started to add up to a point of dislike. I stopped listening to the music, but then the ads started to come into the podcasts. For the last 3 years had this not happened. Please change it back.",NEGATIVE
If I say play my liked songs don't play songs that I didn't like I liked them for a reason so I can listen to it,POSITIVE
"This app is great for streaming music, but it's gotten this habit of just closing randomly, even in the mode of a song. I thought this would go away after a month but no, plz fix this",NEGATIVE
Since the update it constantly crashes,NEGATIVE
"I disabled the automatic and timer player, but nothing works on this app ! Waking me up at 12 am !!!! With this music that I don't even like and I couldn't find a way to delete this music from play recently or from history!",NEGATIVE
"This app does not work, song quality is subpar. Find literally anything else.",NEGATIVE
Best music app period,POSITIVE
"Terrible android performance lately. Loss of audio, playbar constantly disappearing. Constant Bluetooth issues. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
I don't understand why I had to put it 1 star for 3 months. Changed to 4 stars,NEGATIVE
I really like this app you can listen to everything but there are a lot of add,POSITIVE
Nice with excellent music/I like the sound of the music,POSITIVE
Collection is good. But genre of any song can be added in the information and selection panel. So any user can play their favourite genre. It's just a suggestion.,POSITIVE
Full of adds for every 5 mins.,POSITIVE
"Every time I play the sound, for example the song ""tak ingin usai"", when I play the song instead of ""tak ingin usai"" it's another song instead.",NEGATIVE
"Fun, good music selection",POSITIVE
"Can't really use cuz can't play songs that I like because it add songs for you, deing able to download 1-2 songs for free,light mode but like I'm gonna use it and make it easyer to find settings (mobile)",NEGATIVE
"Never take their offer. They wont stop charging you! Its because anyone on your network can click on premium and your paying. No way to stop this, have to delete Spotify and never use it again. Only option. You will have to cancel your bank card. They will ask for pictures of your bank account to prove it. Dont trust these criminals at all with your bank info.",NEGATIVE
Best music quality of all music apps.Even all new and old songs are present on Spotify. And provides you playlists of your own choice.,POSITIVE
Spotify was great ... but now..it's not the same. I cannot get karaoke mode in my samsung tab and for many songs lyrics are not there,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a great app, started using it this year and it has really met my expectations. The premium feature is good and saves one from those ads popping up. The real issue I have is that can you create a mode where one can resume his playlist after playing a particular music or album, coming to start your playlist afresh after listening to an album can be sad. I once resume my playlist during the free listen mode but I can't anymore using the premium feature.",POSITIVE
Love it so much haven't experienced any problems so far. It's good to listen to podcasts while jogging or busy with work that doesn't need my full attention.,POSITIVE
Great selection of music and podcasts,POSITIVE
Too many ads and can't pick a song always dhaffles.,NEGATIVE
"Bad functionality , sometimes it's nt working proper.",NEGATIVE
"Love the music, love the layout, love eveything about it, only issues I've had were at times not being able to see the year recap, not that important but it's a great feature at the end of the year or decade and lots of people put effort into others and users seeing it, and some look forward to seeing their music efforts or changes or feelings, so it kinda sucks that it can but out for you If you are on a lower end phone or a phone with poor storage, mine has both issues, but otherwise, love it",POSITIVE
Why the hell this crashes everytime,NEGATIVE
Nice app for listening songs,POSITIVE
Very nice app I get all the songs without give money and with very less ad,NEGATIVE
I love that you can multiple playlist it's really wonderful to be able to play the music that you like and the different playlist and even ones with albums to play whenever you want them to or to play continuously it's there are no ads eit I've never loved music more I can pick all the ones that I want and put them in one John and I can pick all the other ones that I really like and put them in another one and then I have at least two that I can listen to but I have five right now and it's great,POSITIVE
I've been using Spotify for a while now and i really like the expirence but lately the app is not opening at i tried everything but it's not opening i humbly request u to fix this problem as i really like this app and it's music quality.,POSITIVE
"Probably the best music app ever made, its only downside is that it doesn't have that much unreleased music",POSITIVE
The best music app n experience ever ..kudos to the creator...but make it a bit cheap to give access to all n sundry,NEGATIVE
Why I like this app it has no ads I hate ads like mad it get me mad any way I give big thanks to the developers I like that keep it up,POSITIVE

This is a good app. And enjoying the song . sounds Quality is good.,POSITIVE
"I don't if it's just me or what, but I hate it when the share lyrics button removed on my spotify, I'd suggest to put that feature again.",NEGATIVE
"This is the best app for listening a music, background,sound quality is awesome, I make a playlist on this app nd it become best ever... ðŸ˜‡",POSITIVE
6skips per hour +they will force you to listen in other song that you don't even want so you are most likely to skip it that's where the annoying part is gonna start... 6skips won't be enough to play the song you want like I mean literally.,NEGATIVE
Absolutely love Spotify.,POSITIVE
"It has a lot of music but there are a lot of small issues. Deluxe versions of albums that I bought on iTunes however long ago aren't available and there's no way for me to add music that I already paid for. The shuffle algorithm is straight up horrible. Also, it'll randomly switch from my liked songs to a song's ""radio"", e.g. a discovery mode. And I don't want that and I'm not sure how or why it happens",NEGATIVE
Full of ads .. they offer 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening and then ad came after every song,NEGATIVE
App won't open my liked songs. Wasn't having this problem until about a month ago.,NEGATIVE
"Cannot pick or choose any song from the album list..only can pick the first song..after that,need to wait the album finish shuffled all song..please fix this problem..need a free acces to pick or choose the song we want to play",NEGATIVE
It was awesome can't stop listening to it such a great s*** all the time 247,POSITIVE
"So many broken or faulty things in the app it is embarrassing. Like if I download podcast episodes, I want to be able play them when I do not have an internet connection. But you can't do that since you need a connection to view your download list.",NEGATIVE
"Good app but there is problem I face Every time.When I am using with network it does not work.Therefore I have to use von every time.It just annoying to connect vpn every time.so, that was thoughts about these annoying thing.",NEGATIVE
Can't play on s22 without it pausing when screen is locked. Changed permissions and reinstalled and hasn't changed,NEGATIVE
Good to listen even if you dont have premium,POSITIVE
Very bad do not download why paying for something which is free forever!,NEGATIVE
"Most entertaining and exciting,with excellent switching from one zoner to another swiftly.so many apps for music r there ,but SPOTIFY IS par excellence.",POSITIVE
This is the best music app. Stress buster. Best mind relief. I love this app,POSITIVE
Great music at my fingertips. Love it,POSITIVE
"Buggy mess on samsung fold. Whoever fault it is, the OS does not pick up spotifys audio stream as media, so once you start playing a song it cannot be stopped or interacted with without quitting the app. Audio continues to pay in background on other apps such as YouTube",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify new to it enjoying it,POSITIVE
"Its a good app I like it, but it's so damn annoying bec of the ads. Like i just accidentally clicked some song then literally 3 ads appear & it's unskippable. I'm on mobile. On pc this app works great, so please just let the ads come after a while they keep on popping up.",NEGATIVE
"The app is good but that not the reason why I gave it three stars for the pass month of two my music keeps cutting half way or it will cut from the beginning of the song i can't even go on my other social media apps without Spotify acting up its extremely hard for me to listen to my music. Spotify if the only song / podcast place that I use when my hands are busy, the adverts are just the worse also 6 skip each hour isn't good at all.",NEGATIVE
"It's so good to listen to good music on a user friendly platform,but still room for improvement, Spotify is oviously the best out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOWNLOAD",POSITIVE
"Started off well, could listen to songs and skip songs if I wasn't wanting to listen to that one that day. Then suddenly cannot skip songs. By all means have adverts but allow songs to be skipped. Songs have emotional connections and some days you're not ready for certain songs. I think I will have to delete",NEGATIVE
App stopped working after update. I can only play saved music because the main page or search doesn't appear at all.,NEGATIVE
Superb app. Specially for searching songs,POSITIVE
"Latest update I cannot pause, fast forward a song or close the app. Review just went from 5 stars to 1 star.",NEGATIVE
Right now I'm trying to play my fav song on this app yknow it just starts at the end it didn't even started at the start of the lyrics plus I can't play my fav songs in my playlist it just plays a different songs pls fix this F you Spotify bring back old Spotify!,NEGATIVE
Love it i wish i had premium tho i sadly cant purchase dtuff on my phone,NEGATIVE
"Though not bad enough. But the we want to play, it plays another one. That is annoying thing.",NEGATIVE
This app is good but it should be run offline as well,NEGATIVE
"It's a really good app , you can listen audios, songs, etc while being on another app at the same time. I had no problem signing in in this device, but then I signed in from another device. I inserted the name, password,email etc and all, but it kept loading forever. The app kept on loading the next day and on and on, it never let me in. It's an annoying glitch and it makes me really disappointed and mad. Fix this glitch soon as possible.",NEGATIVE
"great app but ads more...sometime not getting searching song, many troubles this software it hard to login this app and many many problem, would you stop this company go to eat butter chicken",NEGATIVE
I really loves this app is great I've give it a five stars,POSITIVE
Good and easy to use,POSITIVE
Great app! But I really do wish Spotify would include loseless audio for a much better music quality.,NEGATIVE
"I use to love this app. To me, it use to be one of the best music apps. But after last update, it has gone down hill. Now when I listen to a playlist it will just start playing random music and then start the playlist over again. I use to never have any problems. Now it is full of bugs. Until it gets fixed, I won't be using it anymore. Until it is fixed, I wouldn't recommend it to others either.",NEGATIVE
Why i cant update my app you have a new karaoke mode but my app is still not updated.,NEGATIVE
I am able to play music but some of the time the music is going to a different song instead of my actual list and I haven't even finished the playlist yet!!! Fix it.,NEGATIVE
"WHEN A PERSON SELECTS TO CHOSE AN ALBUM, ALL HE WANTS TO LISTEN TO, IS THAT SPECIFIC ALBUM. I HATE HOW RANDOM SONGS END UP INBETWEEN TRACKS OF ALBUMS. I ALSO HATE THE NOT BEING ABLE TO SKIP TRACKS. THE NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AS WELL.",NEGATIVE
No prob with music.excellent,POSITIVE
Please add the add to queue option from search Bar too,NEGATIVE
"You can stream songs in a lot of places this might be the worst, if you want to make a play list they add songs to YOUR play list and give you only 6 skips an hour so you don't get to listen to your own songs on YOUR play list you don't have enough skips to get to your songs and if you delete them of the play list they add more it is very anoing if you just want to play some music.",NEGATIVE
"I get this trash for free from work. Won't use it because of all the hate, and misinformation Joe spreads.",NEGATIVE
"I'm a premium user and I love the app. But for the past one week, It has been showing 'no internet connection' and my network is very good. Please fix this.",POSITIVE
"Absolutely amazing app, can't complain.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify music I can find all of my music that I love music that I grew up with with my sisters and brothers and my mother and father,POSITIVE
"garbage app, i literally can't subscribe to premium, every time i try to click the ""send pin"" it just says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again or contact our support team"", i tried to subscribe on my laptop, used incognito mode, restarted my phone, used a different browser but nothing worked. I'll just stick with YouTube music.",NEGATIVE
I'm on the road all the time this app is great for the random Playlist,NEGATIVE

Too many ads,NEGATIVE
Not working properly,NEGATIVE
I think this is the good app..i really like this app...,POSITIVE
"Been very glitchy recently,. It's really annoying. I just wanna listen to girl kn red and mitski. Is it just mine or?",NEGATIVE
Great app lots of music and can read lyrics too!,POSITIVE
Best app for music and the free premium for a month is good to,POSITIVE
It got some good music on here and easy to work with.,POSITIVE
"Listening to podcasts, however I sort by.. it will play the previous episode next.. instead of the next episode, any advice?",NEGATIVE
Amazing sound and loved the app,POSITIVE
Difficult to keep accounts straight when running a duo but great functionality,POSITIVE
"Pretty nice to be able to listen to music in the background, though some of the ads feel like someone is puncturing my ears with nails and I wish you could turn off that specific ad",NEGATIVE
It's good but when I playy fav song it play other song that I don't like and it makes me mad because I tried it hundred times but still it play other song,NEGATIVE
Best app for listening music ...,POSITIVE
It's good because it is nationwide music app for listening but I hate that I can't become a premium membership because I am in highschool and I don't have money or ATM to pay in Spotify so that is the problem and of course the ads because I am not in premium and when you want to change the music it can't cause it has a limited time only at 30min or you can't change cause only 3 song's only so that's my feedback.HAVE. A GOOD ðŸ˜Š DAY,NEGATIVE
"Overall it's an amazing music app. However, i have recently been unable to see some of the buttons and icons when operating the app. It definitely looks weird and incomplete. It would also be nice if non-premium users would get a chance to join in on the group sessions. I'd have given a 5â­ but I'll do a 2â­ until the issue is resolved.",NEGATIVE
Your App is addictive. It has a unique way of compiling music of same genre by different artist in one place. Great indeed.,POSITIVE
To many adds . After a song you get a add this goes on and on.,NEGATIVE
Very good music excellent to listen to . A fantastic variety of music to choose from,POSITIVE
"The app wont load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone, freezes at logo screen. I pay for this and cant access ANY of my music. That unsubscribe button is looking very tempting..",NEGATIVE
Cant cancel my premium account. There is no option and i have been charged,NEGATIVE
"In love with the new update, the song recommendations and the cross fade when the track changes, just amazing.",NEGATIVE
"I've been trying for so long to find my password by just can't find it on my account, and I can't get my account back in from my Xbox after accidentally gaining out that I was got you 5 so writing and that's the problem. Can you please help me with that?",NEGATIVE
"I love the downloads, although sometimes I would like for them to download a little faster, and if they had that singalong lyrics 2 that would be great",POSITIVE
It's great now I can use this app at my country cause previously you couldn't connect to it,POSITIVE
I'm Very disappointed in this app it keeps playing the other songs that I didn't add in my playlist I skipped many songs but the random songs keep playing in my playlist.,NEGATIVE
"I personally love Spotify, it has got amazing songs and podcasts too but my complaint has got to be about the length of the adverts and just the adverts in general, I can agree with giving 2 ads every now and then but when it's the same repetitive long ad coming on 3 times that's when I get annoyed and it is fair enough to put ads in if not paying for premium but I just feel they are too long. Other then that I love this app!",NEGATIVE
Would definitely recommend Spotify to a friend.,POSITIVE
10/10 its just a tad bit difficult skipping songs on iphone.,NEGATIVE
Love this music app!,POSITIVE
Best online music platform ever.,POSITIVE
"App is a mess, playback wont continue anymore. Sick to death of this ""premium"" service that constantly cuts in and out. Sick of posting help post in community. Going back to pirating.",NEGATIVE
"False advertisement Well ihave been using jio savan but iam sick of adds in the middle of songs uninstalled the app. Then coincidentally i saw soo many adds related to spotify telling its add free, for this reason iam sold. After installing 1st day is normal no adds, started in the nxt day. So many adds foe every single sond there is add, if you really showing adds then dont advertise as add free.",NEGATIVE
The best music app indeed.,POSITIVE
Why don't your l have the premium mini And why did you're make this app can't listen to a music with out paying,NEGATIVE
The sound turns off even though it shows the song is being played.,NEGATIVE
"hires audio online app, enjoy every music clear crisp",POSITIVE
I really like it but I wish we could select the songs of our choice and skip the 1 we don like without premium,NEGATIVE
It provides everything I need to listen to music from the past and present.,POSITIVE
"Amazing app, if you fix that it doesn't add more than one songs to queue and randomly skips queues when opened and played straight from the bar below...And please bring lossless music asap.",NEGATIVE
We can hear songs in between adds Prepared for adds play list Every song adds,NEGATIVE
Such a good app I mean what's wrong about it you have a repeat playlist so you can listen to your favorite songs but one thing add more skips plz Spotify well by adding more skips still a five stars ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
The new update is incredibly nice and sound quality is good! Spotify Premium is truly worth it. I absolutely recommend Spotify more than other music streaming services. Thank you Spotify! ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Doesn't have streaming issues n it quite entertaining and you gotta get it if u don't already have it,NEGATIVE
i dunno why the lyrics cant appear even it's premium.. help me,NEGATIVE
bro I be spending hours listening to music on this app i love it. it works fine most of the time (the ads are annoying but I understand that there need to be ads for the app to be free) but I really like making playlists and stuff.,POSITIVE
I want shuffle button for free user or make this app non free user anymore,NEGATIVE
I love being able to feel emotions by music. Spotify is amazing.,POSITIVE
"Its a great app but I genuinely hate the fact they took away to preview songs, And the ads have been getting massively out of hand. I get like 5-6 in between 2 songs.",NEGATIVE
"I really enjoy Spotify. It's only real drawback are the ads. I understand the necessity, but some (many) podcasts play the same ad up to three times IN A ROW. Extremely annoying.",NEGATIVE
"It's yo good, I can't say anything to increase it",POSITIVE
"The best music app, i was a Gaana plus user and recently switched to Spotify. I am very much happy, Spotify app is very much polished and bug free than Gaana and Music recommendations are also spot on.",POSITIVE
First time using it. Love it's variety and rich sound!,POSITIVE
Easy to use and love all the options for listening pleasure,POSITIVE
The quality is excellent but the subtitles is not updated and some were not accurate.,NEGATIVE
So very nice is spotofy app,POSITIVE
"Props 2 the writer of the short but informative Intel. When u dig into the bands page& read their history. As a metal head during its prime I think ur pretty spot on most of the stories about how the bands portrayed the music in that time and how the fans seen them. The app is great BTW. Been a paid customer 4 about 6 plus yrs. Not sure how long I can hang on being a paid customer, as we all know r country is going 2 hell in a hand basket, only essentials around the corner. Pray 4 us as humans",POSITIVE
They hold your downloaded songs hostage unless you pay or uninstall the app. They don't even have permission to my files but they found a way into them I guess.,NEGATIVE
"On any other phone this would be a 5 star review, I'd just like to bring attention to the fact that the app is barely usable on the Galaxy Note 9. It acts like it doesn't have internet access when it does (regardless of the WiFi or 4G network I'm connected to) and it takes about 5-10 minutes to realize it actually has internet access, then takes another minute or so to load my library.",NEGATIVE
"While online, stops playing after 10 seconds of 1 in 5 songs. While offline, completely refuses to play 1 in 5 downloaded songs. Constantly forgets which songs I liked. Offline mode sucks. Tapping the 3 dot menu on a song spends 3 seconds trying to load even though there is clearly nothing to load. I can't browse music by artist and album, only filtering the list of all downloaded songs which doesn't even work. Typing an artist's name often onlow shows 20% of their songs I downloaded.",NEGATIVE
"It's very good and has 100% helped me during meltdowns to calm down. Other than small issues, it's decent. I can't change the playback volume anymore. 3 stars",POSITIVE
Love the music and my Playlist.,POSITIVE
Fun and fast both nastalgic and Inlightning with recommendations.,POSITIVE

Constantly pauses playback...trash. its 2022 streaming is nothing new there is zero reason for any bs,NEGATIVE
The best and easiest music option,POSITIVE
"Spotify is absolutely awesome,",POSITIVE
Current version very glitchy for music playback. 10+ hiccups(micro pauses per song).,NEGATIVE
You put songs in my playlist that I don't want in my playlist cuz I just want to listen to my music on repeat and won't let me play songs i search for,NEGATIVE

You can do a lot of stuff but ads pop up a lot,NEGATIVE
I get to listen to good music and do something also.,POSITIVE
"The app freezes and I have to reset it ALL THE TIME. Please, fix this 'cause I love the music quality and the all the app's functions.",POSITIVE
Worst app ever. Service provider music player horrible. Dont bother subscribing some how it's worse when you pay monthly does not matter the device. I rather have my phone open and listen to YouTube for free then pay 15$ for this broken garbage,NEGATIVE
The songs are spirit filled songs they are beautiful,POSITIVE
"Great app just missing a few songs., if you can take advantage of 90 free trail. It's worth it for downloading music.",NEGATIVE

Please add option to listen from the beginning when playing podcasts episodes.,POSITIVE
Cool. Played for background while bridge ladies were here. They wanted to know about it. So I showed them that I had it on my phone. They loved it.,POSITIVE
"I've used Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, and this one is my new favorite music streaming app. I have premium currently. The song radios are seamless and it's easy for the most part to navigate the app. Some things are much more convenient on the PC version, like moving lists of songs from one playlist to another. I'm glad it warns you if you are about to add a song to a playlist that already has the same song, it lessens the likelihood of repeats.",NEGATIVE
Mind-blowing very lovable app for me ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ðŸ¥°â™¥ï¸ðŸ”¥better sound quality and minimum ads which is good â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
"I had problems soon after installing the app. It seems impossible to shut it off completely. I was trying to travel using the Waze app for navigation. Spotify kept playing music unexpectedly interfering with my trip. The only quick solution was uninstall it, so I could safely travel using Waze as intended.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is best,POSITIVE
I love spotify I use it every day,POSITIVE
Awesome app. Never going back to other apps,POSITIVE

Pretty reliable bad cell service or not,NEGATIVE
"Used to always crash before. But it's okay now, loving it! Music keeps me sane. Ive heard abt the karaoke feature. Cant wait!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Sick of spotify blaming their awful service on customers with ""high expectations."" OH, you are sorry the service didn't work as I EXPECTED IT TO????? I guess it was too much to assume that your garbage app would do anything it said it would, just like you corporate clowns. My bad. Keeps getting worse and worse. Right on the cusp of canceling. I'd rather have no music than deal with this headache.",NEGATIVE
"I'm going to be discontinuing this service. They play the same songs over and over again on the artist channels. But more than anything, it's their support for that right-wing podcast person and paying him millions of dollars to spew out hatred and the Trump type of ugliness. I definitely prefer calm radio and it's a much better deal",POSITIVE
"Bloatware garbage, unsolicited & pushed onto people with Samsung phones just like the Facebook & Netflix apps. Any app/business that forces itself onto customers of other products obviously isn't customer focused, rather it behaves like a scammer. Will never use Spotify again.",NEGATIVE
Sound comes in and out every 4 seconds or so. I don't have this issue with any other app. I love Spotify but not if I can only listen to music in 4 second intervals.,NEGATIVE
"I highly recommend using this, no subscription needed to enjoy!",NEGATIVE
"Great app overall but I don't like how it's different on iPads and phones, I would like to choose a specific song and not listen to only a preview.",NEGATIVE
Best music app there is. Legit not one song I haven't been disappointed knd.,POSITIVE

Great anytime music app.,POSITIVE
Music has always been like a getaway for me and this really has helped me through hard times!!,POSITIVE
Spotify is hands down the best music app I've used. It has every song you could imagine and lots of fanmade playlists to enjoy. It also has a fair parental ristriction that still gives a good 70 percent of the music. Defo recommend,POSITIVE
My choice of app for music and commentary,NEGATIVE
There should be just a few more free options,NEGATIVE
Thise are a very usefull app and it get u all the songs ure looking for from old-school to new generation stuff,POSITIVE

App keeps not showing the song or podcast (time line with the skip back and forth icons),NEGATIVE
"I don't understand what everyone is saying. I'm a free user and I can still play any song i want, I don't get ads and I don't have limited skips. So I don't see what the problem is. Love this app â¤",NEGATIVE
It's easy to use. An I have found every artist I pur in,POSITIVE
Great app only problem is it is to big for me to keep on my phone Would be good if it was possible to move app to SD card,NEGATIVE
"Switched from Amazon Music to Spotify, so far I only see improvements, no unnecessary extra subscriptions to listen to my favourite songs. I'll definitely be sticking with Spotify for the foreseeable future. ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
I like it it plays what I want to hear the music I like to hear you know it plays continually even if I cut the phone off so I do like this app a lot Recommend it for everyone,POSITIVE
It has like all the songs. ðŸŽµ It is also super easy to find the song you won't to listen to. There is the perfect amount of ads as well. You can listen to songs anywhere you like.,POSITIVE
"All the music I could ever want, and more! It's my understanding that Spotify doesnt censor out dissenting views in podcasts, That is why I signed up. So refreshing to see an organization with integrity!",POSITIVE
Sooo glitchy. Doesn't reliably play podcasts. Skips songs on its own. Not very good,NEGATIVE
Love my Spotify !! â¤ Thank you !!ðŸ‘ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
Best music I just need premium.,NEGATIVE
Alot of ads but dose the job,NEGATIVE
I can listen to all my fav songs And podcasts,POSITIVE
This update is so disappointing when I make my own playlist it's suck because of the shuffle and it's start to play some song that I don't even add on my playlist,NEGATIVE
Lots of ads but other than that it's a great app to use especially if you're not great at making playlist cuz I have lots of those ready to go,POSITIVE
If I had chance I wouldn't give one star because too many ads are so disappointing that's why please if you don't want to hear ads repeatedly then don't download this app. The main problem is that after 1 to 2 songs again and again bloody boring ads. The Worst app I have ever downloaded ðŸ˜‘ ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
Easy to use. Great selection.,POSITIVE
"Really good app, new to it , with no prob.",POSITIVE
God this app is so annoying like there 10 ads after every 3 songs like wthðŸ™„ðŸ™„,NEGATIVE
Awesome Always playing this over any station on my Alexa,POSITIVE
I use this app all the time. Got it on practically all my devices. But for some reason it stoped worked. Doesn't load anything. Says all playlist don't have anything in them anymore. And it keeps saying it's offline even though I got internet. Ive tried deleting and redownloading multiple times and it still won't work.,NEGATIVE
"This app is seriously so buggy. I used to love Spotify but it skips like CD. Well turn off when the screen goes dark (the only reason any of us pay for you tube is to avoid this). Also, I've had the play bar disappear on me and I couldn't pause and play the song. I had to exit the app to turn off audio. I'm getting so sick of it and I've told my husband it's not worth an endless library of songs and podcasts if I can't enjoy listening to them. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing.",NEGATIVE
"Absolutely awesome app! I've been listening to my liked songs for so long. Spotify doesn't even have a lot of adds. I honestly give the app five stars. â­â­â­â­â­ Edit: this app is great, but I can't play a specific song without having to use my skips, (which are 6 for free listeners) so I took 1 star off. Please fix this",NEGATIVE
"Spotify gets to know you and will make you cry when you need to cry, laugh when it's time to let go, and smile when you remember everything you've been through and how strong you are now because of it.",POSITIVE

"Great sound, wide variety",POSITIVE
App is trash.. If you can use podcast addict do it. They are awesome. This app crashes glitches stops and starts randomly and denies control at times. If it wasn't for Rogan I'd never have downloaded it.,NEGATIVE
Wow great app for music,POSITIVE
Me and my fiance that's overseas can listen from the same Playlist... it's another way we connect with each other when he's gone...,NEGATIVE
"there was a drop down thing that I think has recently got removed when you search for a song on the app. it was useful to add a song in a playlist, etc., directly without having to first play the song and sometimes sit there for an ad to get over. it also makes the whole process tedious having to do it with multiple songs. I don't know if this review will be taken into consideration, but it'll be appreciated if it gets reverted back to its earlier state.",NEGATIVE
I enjoy the choices of artist and songs I can choose,POSITIVE
Best Music app have come across! Getting all my favourite music and all i want! Mahn this the best no need of more already this is enough.. is good to go with. Clear sounds too. This 10/10,POSITIVE
Constant shutdowns and issues despite updated software and new android.,NEGATIVE
Started off great. Seems like lately Spotify had been laggy and unresponsive at times. Stops playing music for no reasons. And it's annoying that it ask every time I log in to enable Bluetooth. Debating if I should keep paying for premium ðŸ¤”,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, and all of the great features. If anything I wish I could add all of my liked songs from one artist to a playlist.",POSITIVE
It's a good app to listen to your favorite songs some people complain about the 6 skips an hour but its great it gives you a chance to find new music / new things you might be interested it or likeðŸ‘. Overall great app,POSITIVE
I like 50s and 60s ðŸŽ¶ holds lots of memories for me and hubby John that I care for 24/7 we have sing song just the two of usðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ’ž,POSITIVE

Theres this glitch were the play bar gets removed so i have to keep uninstalling and installing this god dam app,NEGATIVE
"By far the worst music app. Plays the same 10 songs every time you shuffle, ads are beyond annoying, and you can't even view album anymore without paying. Back to pirating",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify!!! I love that I can listen to music offline. ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•,POSITIVE
to the person who said you can't organize your music by genre: yes you can,NEGATIVE
Watch app is not working properly I hit the play button and it sends me to bluetooth but if I skip the song it will play and is able to play on watch with quick control buttons,NEGATIVE
Spotify is amazing ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
The best app ever....runs smooth â¤,POSITIVE
"You can't choose specific songs without paying... So this is basically just the radio... Still with ads... There's no reason to use this service ever, can't believe anyone would give them money, I'm afraid to see what their 'premium' service actually offers",NEGATIVE
Spodify is cool. The only issue is. You cannot play your favorite song on repeat unless you pay. So they'll play music that you're not even interested in which is the biggest con.,NEGATIVE
Why does this crash constantly?,NEGATIVE
"when i add songs to queue, only the last added song shows up and then it plays backwards, so, from the last added song",NEGATIVE
So dumb that you guys were out for a while and silly haven't fixed this app like I pick a song and it puts on another song that just didn't even pick I recommend people to use another app instead of this one,NEGATIVE
"Even after a new update, spotify never works properly. Now the issue is its not playing podcast videos. Really tired of paying for an app that never works. Cleared my cash, force stopped the app, checked settings allow all data and not save pods as audio only",NEGATIVE
"After free trial ends it's just a overall trash appðŸ˜” but you can fix that by paying premium ðŸ‘ after that it's the best music app I promise, but if you don't want to pay for premium I suggest SoundCloud",POSITIVE
Not bad great app. Continue promoting the music,POSITIVE
It really works. The quality is excellent and the music choices available are abundant. Great App. *****,POSITIVE
This app is awful.. I used to love it but it has recently stopped working. I can't do anything on it and there is not way to fix it.,NEGATIVE
"A good way to hear music we like on the go, at home, at the office",POSITIVE
"Easily my favorite music app, Spotify is the best in my opinion. The simple user interface, super deep catalog of music/podcasts and it's well worth the subscription to not hear the commercials ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"After getting the 1 month subscription Spotify app on my windows 11 is not working! It shows ""Spotify can't play this right now. if u have the file in your computer you can import it"". I have even tried reinstalling the app but it still acts the same. + All Songs aren't downloading in my mobile!",NEGATIVE
"Favorite music streaming app. Been using it for years along with Premium and have had little to few problems. Imo, worth the $10 a month. By being a beta tester (which I am as well), you can test new things they're thinking about adding to the app for a short period of time and its quite interesting!",POSITIVE
I hate this app. You are too selfish to even listen to the fact that this app is not continuing to play music like it's supposed to when you update this music listening app. It loves stopping in the middle of a song and not keep playing like it's meant to do. This is pitiful for everyone and not enjoyable. I looked for a solution to this problem. But all have failed.,NEGATIVE
I used my boyfriends card one time to make a payment and they went and took two payments off with out permission. I did not save the card to the account,NEGATIVE
Love it. No adds just music.,POSITIVE
one song one ad of 30 second.... really very dissapointed with spotify... rudiculous way to beg for the money...,NEGATIVE
"When you play a song, you should see at the bottem which song you are playing and how far you are in the song. But I can't see that anymore please fix thisðŸ™ðŸ»",NEGATIVE
Incredible ðŸ˜ƒ is this for music I love ðŸ˜˜ it all time in this app,POSITIVE
I love listening to music when I work read and draw. I love Spotify and the podcast,POSITIVE
I'm really really irritated that you only get six skips in your liked list. What if I'm not in the mood to listen to a song that I like? At LEAST give us unlimited skips in our own Playlists. Please. I know I'm not the only one frustrated.,NEGATIVE
So far it's okay we'll just grab more later when it starts playing a list of songs that I really like,POSITIVE
"Like a meth head selling his daughter on the corner do this- 3 month free trail, after 2.5mths make a new email and account then share playlists rinse and repeat (I am poor can't afford a cup of noodles)",NEGATIVE
Overall the app is great when it works but the daily crashes are an issue,NEGATIVE
Great and easy app,POSITIVE
Been using Spotify for a decade or so and get nostalgic with some of the songs I've started from back in the day. Thanks Spotify,POSITIVE
Dont know if its the song or the app but all im getting are bits and blurbs of songs,NEGATIVE
Horrible. Why can't I play a Playlist in order without premium. What's the use of calling it a Playlist if its always on shuffle?,NEGATIVE
Music quality is fine ; decent but for the non premium member its going disappointing day by day .. in my first experience ads appears then after 6 songs now this is after the every 2 songs ... this is not done ... thinking for Uninstall this app ....untill the margin increases to 6 songs ðŸ˜” ðŸ˜Ÿ ðŸ™,NEGATIVE
"The experience is very good and I recommend choosing this streaming service, other fancier streaming services are more expensive but not all phones can handle that quality so that's why Spotify is a good choice for most of the devices out there because only higher end phones are capable of super high resolution anyways",NEGATIVE
Good app. I can find most of the music I enjoy listening to. However if you do not get the premium you have to listen to a lot of play lists in order to hear the music you like.,POSITIVE
Rated it one star cause before we could listen to all songs in the desktop app we can listen to songs normally but in phone after the update we only can preview songs even the ones that were there in my playlist please fix this,NEGATIVE
"Used to love Spotify, after the last 6months or so it's just been a glitchy mess and every update does nothing to change it getting to the point I want to cancel and find a better service",NEGATIVE
Worst experience ever I've buyed 1 month subscription and just after that my Spotify is not responding anymoreðŸ¥²,NEGATIVE
I can find what I'm looking for easily.,POSITIVE
Superb sound quality Spotify discribed in 3 word SSQ,NEGATIVE
"I have premium but even then, sme songs can't be played whole offline. For example, the song Cold Cold Cold by Cage the Elephant is gray and when you click on it it says it's unavailable. It's one of my favorite songs and I can't listen to it offline.",NEGATIVE
Using for 2 years lately the app is crashing nonstop,NEGATIVE
Best music app out there. Premium is worth the purchase.,POSITIVE
The app is very very nice. I love this app so so much....,POSITIVE
"Why can't you find a full list of songs by an artist? They're obviously there as you can search for a specific track and bam it's there, but if you do a general search for an artist only 5 tracks show up",NEGATIVE
Its out of rhis world. No words ro desscribe. Its an Awesome expeeience,POSITIVE
Whenever Im hearing a playlist its always shuffled but the problem is there is no shuffle button. And I couldn't see the songs that were included in the playlist. PLEASE FIX THIS. Its stressing me out.. Edit: I'm sorry I keep whining but please fix this.. Please please please please please please please,NEGATIVE
It's a very good music app but it would be nice if the lyrics came in Tamil,POSITIVE
Love the premium features,POSITIVE
This app is not working properly,NEGATIVE
I give four star because we have to give money for listening to songs add free,POSITIVE
Very good and I think everyone can use it,POSITIVE
Seems like lately every time I boot up Spotify it gets stuck on the loading screen or it'll display the song but it just won't play. It's as though it's paused and it'll say that I'm disconnected from the internet despite having signal or Wi-Fi and all my other apps work. Also sometimes when I boot up and it the queue will disappear along with the player that shows the song I was listening to last.,NEGATIVE
App never works always crashing and lagging I Uninstalled to reinstall and now it won't load,NEGATIVE
"This is a great app for creating and sharing playlists, discovering new music/artists/podcasts, and releasing your own work. It is definitely worth buying premium.",POSITIVE
"I really enjoy the scope of music thats available if you can think of if they have it. Ths one thing that rubbed me wrong was, when I set this up I wanted the family plan? I was unable to set up my wife with Spotify and I hear about it from time to time. I should'nt have to tell you about it here but I couldn't get anyone to help with the setup.",POSITIVE
Wynk is more user friendly... After each song ads comes,NEGATIVE
I always have service even working in a warehouse if I go out of town. I listen to music like people watch TV. Music is therapy and it's a constant thing in my house. I love the no ads/ commercials either,POSITIVE
Great but less advertised,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy my music. Spotify is the best App.,POSITIVE
"It's been great, only issue I may have is, with my one very big Playlist, it still repeats some songs, as though there is only like 20 songs instead of 100, but besides that I enjoy it",POSITIVE
Used to love this app to recently. Now I can't play Playlist or artist I look up. Acting up lately,POSITIVE
Earlier app was very good and 2 ads come at a tym now 4-5 ads come at a tym and is very difficult to listen on it and network problem is also there,NEGATIVE
The kareoke option is not working for me.I updated the app but still it doesn't work.It worked only once so I thought of doing it again but I don't have that option now,NEGATIVE
Best music app I have seen,POSITIVE
"Except ads being how bad spotify ads are, this is a good app",NEGATIVE
This app is more concentrating on ADs rather playing a music...even if you here saying listen music without 30 min interruption still after 5 min you will listen a shirt AD... Why should I purchase your app..only to stop ads..common...only stupid people will buy your app to stop ads...rather I will download songs and hear them,NEGATIVE
"I dont know what the matter is, but this app, it doesn't want to download at all...trust me my storage space is enough for apps twice the size of mb of spotify idk why it doesnt want to download but I've been trying to download it for the past 5days!!!",NEGATIVE
Too much annoying ads...,NEGATIVE
"i cant play a song without getting to another song firstly . Like i search for a song to play but then when i tap play â–¶ï¸ it comes out another song that i dont know so then i need to skip 2 or 3 songs for it . Pls fix it , i can't hear a song while sleeping :( Overall its okay",NEGATIVE
"Recent updates have made the app awful. Always cuts out on Bluetooth, app freezes often and the downloaded songs aren't accessible",NEGATIVE
I like that I can just pick whatever song or album I want.,NEGATIVE
It's just amazing. Better than apple music.,POSITIVE
"This is an amazing app for music like it's on the top for me but the only problem is with advertisements,like when an ad comes before a song and it says that now you can enjoy the next 30 minutes ads but after one or 2 songs which are not clearly of 30 minutes there is a another ad like it is a straight up scam and this happens all along a huge playlist and to me it is annoying so I hope this can be fixed....... Otherwise I would give 5 â­ rating. Thanks",NEGATIVE
Best app for listening songs ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,POSITIVE
A ton of content for a reasonable price,POSITIVE
Can't sort podcasts by language,NEGATIVE
Why is the app version restricting than the desktop version? 6 skips per hour and it doesnt even play songs in the playlist that I created it plays songs randomly,NEGATIVE
"I just hope you could improve it a bit by including ""related search song""; where you search for a song and it's relation continue to play. Hope you get that?",POSITIVE
Why can't you guys set it up so i can move it to my sd card. It hogs up too much space on my phone.,NEGATIVE
It's just an awesome app.it has everything i would want in an app. Keep up the good work!!,POSITIVE
I can find specific versions of songs that I can't on any other music streaming service,NEGATIVE
I have no issues in finding a song. I really like and injoy spotify,NEGATIVE

App good ads too bad one or 3 songs after 3 advertised hate this but love app songs,POSITIVE
would be great if there's an option for me to change the sequence of songs in the playlist from my phone itself,NEGATIVE
Awesome app that's why I am giving 5 stars without ads and clear music and number of playlists than you Spotify ...,POSITIVE
"I few songs I couldn't get on there because they were remixes, but otherwise it's great! Not a single ad with premium eitherðŸ˜Œ it also continues to play the songs when my screen goes off and my notifications don't interrupt!ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
"Spotify use to be a 5 star app, adding lyrics was a great addition, and they have a lot of social media influence. However all the other major streaming apps have some type of high-res streaming subscription offer. Why is Spotify so far behind in this!? Artists spend lots of time creating intricate details in music through Dolby Atmos, and Spotify doesn't even give us a chance to stream it that way. Saying they're working on it while other companies have already rolled it out. Let's catch up",NEGATIVE
"It's amazing but as a beginning artist is not too fair, still couldn't live without it. Luvz on Spotify",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is an outstanding music platform, with different genres for all types of music orientated people. Signed G",POSITIVE
Superb App it is very amazing sound quality also superb and no network issue it work in village area also I give 5 star,POSITIVE

"Great app, makes life happier.",POSITIVE
Good quality and consistent play format..my go to app,POSITIVE
"If I click to play music on PC, it shouldn't start playing podcast on my phone's speakers! Basic stuff, hire product manager.",NEGATIVE
I love it until some@$$ hacked my account and list all my playlist. Ughhh,NEGATIVE
"Song recommendations were good at first, now they are just repeating over and over again. Just found out that I have followers (W.T.F.?), and I DON'T WANT followers, but I can't remove them, unless I block them. Really really sad about this, I hesitated for a long time in paying for a music app and I'm very disappointed with spotify. 2/5 stars",NEGATIVE
"Awesome. Keep on rolling with the songs,thank you",POSITIVE
"Lately the free version is unusable, two adds after every two songs. I am not going too buy that stuff anyway, and yes, they are the same two adds every time.",NEGATIVE
One more large downside I've noticed. Can we somehow gain the ability to expand upon only the top 5 songs by a single artist & make it so we can organize a single artists entire list of songs ever by popularity?,NEGATIVE
Works well. 30 minutes free of no ads by listening to only 2. All my favorite songs are on here!,POSITIVE
Poor playlist function,NEGATIVE
"Adds song to my playlist and won't let me remove them, THIS APP SUCKS DO NOT GET IT!",NEGATIVE
Spotify keeps crashing in the past hour and i already try to reinstall but it doesnt solve the problem,NEGATIVE
"I mean, I get premium for 10$ so I'm happy. I wouldnt want to pay more though",NEGATIVE
"Ads are too many, too often, and too long. Very annoying and you can't fast forward thru the commercials.",NEGATIVE
"awful app. if you need to buy premium just to play the songs you want, might aswell put Spotify not for free. because i cant even listen to the songs i want to listen and could only skip 6 songs an hour.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify premium. I get to add whatever songs I like with no ads. And I love that you can download your music to listen offline. This is my second month and I love it.,POSITIVE
Very good music app,POSITIVE
"This new update is changing inside the Spotify, everytime I play my liked song, it only play for 10 second only, unlike the old Spotify, everytime I tap my Like song, it always play the full. I want the old Spotify, this new Spotify is bad.",NEGATIVE
Really good music app,POSITIVE
Best ever app for listening either latest or old songs and also podcasts,POSITIVE
"I love this app,i think i have seen a music app like this",POSITIVE
The game is good but if i play my song its not the song i wanted but the app is still goodðŸ˜,POSITIVE
I love this I can save the music that I listened ðŸ’—,POSITIVE
Best music experience ever,POSITIVE
Awesome Features! Amazing music!,POSITIVE
"The app doesn't even work, as it doesn't allow me to listen to the music I want to listen to, but instead makes me listen to random songs I've never heard before. Most terrible and useless app I have ever seen. And on top of all of this, they prevent you from doing things such as skipping more than six times per hour, and puting songs on repeat, unless of course you're willing to pay. You've lost a user, since money is obviously more important to you than user convinience.",NEGATIVE
Worst app ever can never skip back to your song and if you click play it continues with whatever it skipped to and that's stupid also u can only skip so much times worst app experience ever rating -100,NEGATIVE
Just ads ads and ads . Ads > music ðŸ¤®,NEGATIVE
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?,NEGATIVE
"Horrible app, you cant play songs, when you do it just doesnt work, though the ads are not too bad, would rather use youtube because i can CHOOSE what song i want to play, absolute L",NEGATIVE
"Good quaility sound, and easy to acces to.",POSITIVE
Best app i ever seen but there are not perfect remix version,NEGATIVE
"Ads after every song? Not to mention the ads are priority as they don't take time to load off my CELL DATA, yet the song buffers here and there as loading it's data isn't priority over and data. Oh also nice false advertising, ""get 30 minutes and free after listening to these ads"" I measure the time, and it gets shorter each time, first time it was 27 minutes before an ad, then 22, eventually I measured it lower but can't remember. Good job Spotify, you're throwing yourself away.",NEGATIVE
Idk what happens to the app everything I search is just buffering with full network,NEGATIVE
Used to love this but can't even use it now. It doesn't play anything anymore. Says no internet when all other apps working fine on net. All playlists are apparently now empty. I am paying for a service i can't use. NOT HAPPY AT ALL. Fix this now or lose more customers.,NEGATIVE
Thank you so much for fixing the bugs!!!â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Very cool app because I can not getting back With Another Event and I will be there at about the same as the one I have is a good time to come by and look at your schedule,POSITIVE
Too many ads..after every song an adds start playing it's very annoying.... And their it is said that after this as you can enjoy 30 minutes uninterrupted music but it's not true......,NEGATIVE
It's good but doesn't work with weak WiFi signals,NEGATIVE

Works well and customer service is great,POSITIVE
"The app is very good for listening music,but the lyrics spellings are totally mistaked,so please check the issue",NEGATIVE
Listening to my favorite songs is easy and without adds.,NEGATIVE
This is becoming the worst app day by day. After 2 to 3 songs we just hear the advertisement of buying premium spotify . You even don't know how to attract the customers you are just disturbing their enjoyment. we don't want to buy the premium Spotify but still you are just adding advertisement which is disturbing the customers and I am sure that all the customers will delete this app because of this and you have already got 4.3 ratings and it will take no time to convert into 3.,NEGATIVE
"Its a very awsome app and i have got all of my childhoodcollection on your app,i felt so good refreshing my childhood memories,however the drawback is the subscription part.",POSITIVE
"I can't even play any song I like, like fr when I pick any song and try to play It, It already has this annoying Shuffle Play ButtonðŸ˜’",NEGATIVE
All the music you need!,POSITIVE
"It's amazing, but the ads and can't download part is the only sad thing",NEGATIVE

They try hard to make the ad paid version useless to tic you off and force you to go premium. I shut the ap off and use other avilable services when it does this.,NEGATIVE
I really really hate the adverts and you can't even mute the volume,NEGATIVE
Best streaming platform,POSITIVE
Best music platform for sure,POSITIVE
The Spotify app is very user friendly and the Google Assistant incorporation makes it very easy to play my favourite music wherever I am.,POSITIVE
There is a great choice of music for the seniors and the quality is good too. Hope we will see more and more choices esp in the traditional indian music categories. Thank you and keep up the entertanment.,POSITIVE
It is only good on premium or on PC. And if you don't have premium it is just annoying not just with the ads but with just trying to listen to a full song. You can't just go look for a song and play it you have to put it in an album which is on shuffle meaning it just plays them at random unless you have the PREMIUM. Basically just get the free trial and move on or get the PREMIUM.,NEGATIVE
"Still waiting for Podcasts and Canvas feature to be enabled in my country. Nevertheless, good app if you're premium.",POSITIVE
Every songs N music available .just love it,POSITIVE
It's awesome app I really love it ..â¤,POSITIVE

TOO MANYYYYY ADDSSSS.. UNNECESSARY SPOTIFY IS PUTTING ITS OWN ADDS JUST TO CONVINCE US TO PAY. UNACCEPTABLE.,NEGATIVE
Everything I was told about a music getaway as therapy is right on Spotify.... Can't even lie about it. ðŸŽ§,POSITIVE
The app is good and has thousands of songs to choose from including podcasts and other types of audio experiences. The 14 day free trial was nice as the standard premium is only $9.99 making it pretty cheap for the average user.,NEGATIVE
Easy and fun to use credit to the creators of this app,POSITIVE
Makers of this app you did a good job but for favorites it deletes your song if there is more than 28.I sugest you guys look at what the problem is.The rest of the time it is easy to use and is one of the best music apps ever,POSITIVE
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Anyone having issues with music cutting in and out while hooked to blue tooth?,NEGATIVE
Everythings good expect 2 issues i face. 1 we can arrange tge song in playlist manually. And 2 the worst one is too many ads.even they we can listen 30 minutes which is the biggest lie.you will face ad after every single song and most of the time 2 ads back to back which is too much annoying and mood spoiling most of the time.seems like this app never made to be free. Plz plz just stay on your talks.that will be enough for us hope u understand ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º Plz guys like this review so it can be on top,NEGATIVE

A very nice app worth having by any loving music fan,POSITIVE

Great access to incredible music,POSITIVE
"Poor Server Performance. Number of ADs have increased, and for the rest of time the app is just ""loading"". My home WiFi is 100mbps and still the app doesn't play without buffering.",NEGATIVE
I listen to specific podcasts on this platiform. The android update really seemed to not be a good companion to this app. what i dont like is how this app plays continuously and randomly...there's no way to stop it with out going into Apps and forestopping. it drains my ear buds and battery...cant fast forward or rewind. ..does not track the last podcast you.listened to. i keep trying to mess with the settings but for some reason there are limited setting options in the free version.,NEGATIVE
"I suggest App developers reduce ads! It was too much and it made me quite angry when I only heard about 3 songs and the ad appeared while the ad said: ""You will be listening to music for the next 30 minutes"". It's a lie! But these songs are great! Only minus 2 stars because of Ads. ;))",NEGATIVE
I just love Spotify best for kpop music it is in my heart now â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ but ads ðŸŒš make it less,NEGATIVE
"I like it, find new music all the time",POSITIVE
there awesome but the only thing that is not good is that you have to have data or internet so if your traveling and don't have data you can't play music.,NEGATIVE
I enjoy listening to my podcast thru Spotify its easy and I enjoy. Just listening with the no video option.,NEGATIVE
So I have had enough of paying premium Spotify when the past 2/3 months everytime I play Spotify and then lock my phone it stops working have been through all my setting. Have been hoping that the updates that I do help but nope. Getting real sick of it,NEGATIVE

Upgraded my phone to a s22 plus and now the option of seeing the songs that I have liked by a specific artist is gone. Now I have to search through the artists entire library to find what I want,NEGATIVE
"Best music app there are ads but, you can find those songs which you can't find anywhere",POSITIVE
Still love it. Top of my charts.,POSITIVE

Not sure what time to change the same thing nevermind it mean when your base is so beautiful,NEGATIVE

Contacted the support team and they resolved my lyrics issue in few days! Thank you!,POSITIVE
Love listening to music all the time,POSITIVE
Spotify is the best app,POSITIVE
"first off this app isn't free at all i mean with features like being able to skip 6 songs per hour,pushing songs in your playlist by force, and not being to play exat song one by one in your favorite list and not being able to making a song go forward or anything you are forcing users to buy the premium. Don't even let me start it on ads that you have to listen to 3 or 2 ads after two songs .i think you write down LIMITED ACCESS instead of FREE USE.",NEGATIVE
"I HATE IT that Spotify has to add their horrible recommendations to my playlist! This is absolutely stupid and plays songs from artists I don't even care about. I made a playlist to listen to 1 artist only, not a mix of unrelated artists. No wonder people are deleting your stupid app when you do things like this.",NEGATIVE
"Has just about every artist or song I am looking for. Makes personalized playlist and stations just for me.keeps up with the 13,000 songs I have",POSITIVE
Awesome I love it the various options to choose from,POSITIVE

"Best invention ever and if you are not on Spotify, I don't know what you are doing with your life.",POSITIVE
No ads mean no ads yet they still push music calling it a new release when it's just an paid ad for some random song. It's like some other streaming sites like Paramount Plus. They take your money for no-ad plan and run their own promos before the actual content. Promo is an ad!,NEGATIVE
"Cant pick what you want, Forces songs you dont want on playlists, Etc... It's very bad",NEGATIVE
"this app is good, but sometimes there are bugs, like recently the buttons are kind of not in their right positions which is weird lol.",NEGATIVE

It is the best music app in playstor,POSITIVE
Deleting this app. Thumbs down for introducing ads.,NEGATIVE
"It sucks, you can barely listen to the music you want because of shuffle, you only get 6 skips, on pc its good so i am giving 2 stars, and ads just ruin the experience, not even youtube or sound cloud has that many ads and in those you can skip as much as you want",NEGATIVE
All Favorite Super audios are available @Spotify,POSITIVE
None of my spotify playlist have music in them I have Uninstalled twice and still no joy pretty upset as I've been premium payer for quite a long time,NEGATIVE

This app is very nice but sometimes their are so many ads And sometimes I can't play my playlists like if i play a song from my playlists then the second song will not pla from my playlists plz try to repair it,NEGATIVE
Spotify fell off like u can't forward the song and can't skip the song more then 6 times an hour and to top this all off u can't play a specific song and when they say listen to uninterrupted music for 30 mins after watching the short video they only play 10 minutes of music,NEGATIVE
"How is there not an option to remove certain tabs like ""shows to try""or ""stay up to date""? The whole point of spotify is finding music that you like. I don't want to be spammed with the newest Trap or Pop or whatever. It is seriously off-putting.",NEGATIVE
That was good experienceðŸ¤­ but my mom doesn't allow me to listen songs thats why I delete it ðŸ¤£,NEGATIVE
I can find almost anything I want to listen to.,POSITIVE
Excellent app! I'll keep it for life!,POSITIVE
Endless loading screen when trying to listen to downloaded songs whilst offline?,NEGATIVE

I have Spotify premium and its anamzing app with or without it. I love listening to my favorite songs on here. I love that I can connect it to my Alexa speaker so I can play music to go to sleep to.

Love the app!!!,POSITIVE
"My issue is that I not able to listen to the podcast episodes that I downloaded. Every day I go into "" your episodes "" section, and I see that the ' downloaded' mark is not there, even though I have re-download them yesterday. Could you kindly tell me why is it so? What's the point of downloading podcast episodes, when you have to re-download them every single day ? Other features are working just fine.",NEGATIVE
"Only Givin' 3 stars coz, Can't listen music offline",NEGATIVE
What's with the automatic pausing?,NEGATIVE
"Great app for the last 5 years. Lots has been improved upon but other things... (such as the totally unnecessary removal of the home screen widget for Android users as of 8/7) ..have been not so great. For anyone interested, Google ""Spotify widget removal"" and look for the most recent thread posted by the official Spotify team. Reading the comments there will give you an insight to just how asinine removing this feature was. I will add back two stars to this review once this feature is re-added.",NEGATIVE
I love this app it's a great way to listen to music and express yourself the only thing is I wish you didn't have to pay so much to get rid of ads cos the ads are really annoying. Other than that it's amazing,POSITIVE
The best platform for music now. I often forget I have a music player on my phone,POSITIVE
"Hate everything. I hate the navigation, can't see the full playlist sometimes. Just want to find Moshpit by Que Violette, but its shuffled in a playlist. Just no. Not good for music, like I wish artists and podcasters would uoload somewhere else, Spotify SUCKS.",NEGATIVE

Best free music and postcard app,POSITIVE
Pay for premium & Podcast still have automatic ads on top of a podcasts sponsor too. We are entering the age of none stop ads.,NEGATIVE
"Awful, Spotify enables annoying features like autoplay without telling you. Also, after completing the song you were listening to, it gives ""related"" songs that aren't even slightly related to the original genre.... Best yet, you can't even disable it no matter how hard you try. There are some ways to fix this but that's just so much hassle to basically just listen to a regular ol music player on loop.",NEGATIVE
Love the music from different artists all over the world.,POSITIVE
Love you Spotify....You are my everything!!!!,POSITIVE

When I first learned about Spotify. I tried it and I was very happy. Because I listen to music all the time. It relaxes my soul. You have a variety of music to choose from. And how ever list you want to make. Since my husband passed away. My Spotify got cut off . My funds were short couldn't afford it. I was going crazy. The other apps I didn't care for them . I had to have my Spotify. So who's ever ready this try it. Believe me you'll love it. Now I pay it up for three months at a time. Mrs W.,POSITIVE
Great selection of music and other audio media but app will stop play between songs or drop out during one.,NEGATIVE
I am a big fan of spotify but it would be great if you could reduce the ads.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is easier to use than Pandora and has a much better selection of music,NEGATIVE

I truly love listening to all of my playlists on this app. I dislike the amount of ads though.,NEGATIVE
Best music platform. Very classic.,POSITIVE
"Too bad, I can't log in when I am in different country. People like me who is in different country in short period of time has no use of this app.",NEGATIVE

I played the list of songs that I added to my favourites but this app played other songs too that are not in this list. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE
"I left Spotify for Tidal a while back, and returned to Spotify a month ago to find it has improved immensely.",POSITIVE
I never had Spotify till about a month ago & I enjoy everytime I use it. 5 star all the way.,POSITIVE
You used to be able to set up a playlist even without prime. But these days no go without them shoving their own songs onto your playlist. You also can't repeat a song or playlist. Pandora is looking better and better. You also can't see your playlist without moving back and pushing 5 buttons. It makes you work too hard. Very frustrating.,NEGATIVE
"Superb app,but if you add shuffle option for playlists,it will be more helpful.Thankyou",POSITIVE
It's good for music use it almost every day it's confusing how to change plans but it's fine alot of different music and it recommends hood artist from my taste I've told my friends about it I love it easy to work easy to look for music alot of ads if you have standard edition so I would recommend premium,POSITIVE
"Okay so I've been trying to play some music but I doesn't work and plays a random song. It all started when I was in my like list and I was trying to play a song but a different song would be playing instead of the song I wanted. I made a new account and the same thing happened so now I can't listen to the music I want to hear, instead some random song that isn't even in my likes. I was trying to play the song 'Misery Meat"" but, it didn't work and a random song appeared.Please fix this I hate it",NEGATIVE
"I love the app, but for some reason my music is skipping when played through my bluetooth earbuds. #Edit: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.",NEGATIVE
Very good app just needs some minor tweaking in the consistency of audio quality however other than that adds are minimal for non paying. Users and premium is worth its price.,POSITIVE
"Great, except I can't figure out how to download. Nothing works, been googling, trying for 5 minutes. I'm baffled.",NEGATIVE
"Nice App, we can listen all type of songs , without mobile screen on",POSITIVE
"It's good and all, but now ads are over a minute long, and no matter what Spotify adds songs into your playlists and it's annoying. This app is never going to be worth $10/month. Back to Youtube Music it is. Spotify has disappointed me AGAIN.",NEGATIVE

"worst music app that I used till date......more ads than music.......non sense app.....don't install it, if you don't want to waste your time and money",NEGATIVE
Because it won't play the right song and I don't wanna pay,NEGATIVE
"Travelling in and out of service, like I do daily, creates trouble. I'm not skipping a ton of songs, and when I do it's usually music I have already downloaded. It still creates minutes of time where the app can't function. I shouldn't have to be checking my app when I'm driving, no matter where I am. Also, I have had five replacement phones since I committed to Spotify for life. Every time, it forgets my preference to never have the visuals. I shouldn't have to turn this off on an audio app.",NEGATIVE
Been using Spotify as my primary source for streaming music for roughly 8 years now. I've even started my own channel. Only one thing I can't figure out how to delete a private Playlist,NEGATIVE
"Slowly this app is becoming useless, it is free, so what if there is a limit for ads too?",NEGATIVE

"I wish I started on Apple Music or YT music. Spotify shuffle plays the same songs all the time. I have about 1000 songs and it always plays the same 50 on shuffle. The push podcasts everywhere, your feed is mainly podcasts. The only reason I havent switched is because its hard to transfer so many songs to another platform.",NEGATIVE
Smooth jazz easy to use,POSITIVE
Glitchy as hell. I'm constantly restarting the app because it freezes. Basically unusable on my LG V60. Time to cancel?... Get it fixed or get bent. Update: I have now canceled Spotify due to their total lack of interest in fixing their garbage app.,NEGATIVE

App has been randomly pausing my playlist for the past couple of days. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE
A lot of ads but very good ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"With every update this app seems to get worse. Frequent crashes are very annoying. Often when I pick something to play, the app will say ""Spotify is trying to play..."" but it is playing the audio I want, but without the controls to pause/fast-forward/rewind being available. To fix this I have to close the app multiple time and re open it. Spotify is awesome, but the app flat out sucks now.",NEGATIVE
I like Spotify but one problem is that when I want to to hear one song it shows an album and i can't hear the music i want to hear and on the playlists too pls fix this,NEGATIVE

I've paid for this for a while and the moment the payment is late or didn't go through for bank or centrelink reasons it goes back to please update payment. Maybe Spotify needs to improve that for it's regular and long term customers. I won't be using Spotify anymore,NEGATIVE
"I'm glad the pause button got changed back to where it was before. However, I've been trying to do this new super grouper thing, it glitches out when you search for an artist and no names come up (my internet has full bars so it's not that). I clicked off it to retry it a few times but it's completely disappeared now. So I have no way of taking part now. I love Spotify but at the moment I'm giving it 3 stars because every update has something buggy in it.",NEGATIVE
I can't open the app. It's stuck on the start-up screen(or logo screen). I've installed and uninstalled the app a few times already and it still won't budge.,NEGATIVE
Good music good set up,POSITIVE
"One little bug where what was playing wouldn't come up, preventing the ability to pause. Fixed quickly, and been absolutely great otherwise.",NEGATIVE
"Great way to peruse discographies of artists that I love. The (Artist) Radio versions of playlists is better than Pandora's giving more suggestions of similar artists. I love the lyrics feature. It helps to quell the need for a larger & more robust content usually only on a Vinyl LP (still my pref for total package). Love that 12"" format. ;) I'd like to see links to buy any album or single currently playing. Let's give back $$$$$ to the creators of this music & keep this great app sustainable!!",POSITIVE
"Love this app. Unfortunately the volume is too low, especially when I wear earphones. Please fix this problem!",NEGATIVE
spotify can extract local files in sd card storage for offline listening,NEGATIVE
Constantly tries to ram music I've never heard or know I don't like into my playlists. Eventually it ended up purely random. I would never ever pay money for an app on the odd chance it might improve the function. I hate this app,NEGATIVE

"Easy to use, Playlist are a breeze with the library and suggestions.",POSITIVE
Spotty is the best! They have all my favorite music.,POSITIVE
"The app is very nice, I mean better than the other music streamer apps. It has everything a gamer wants. It has relaxing music to calm you down while having a battle and it also has music to motivate you when you are about to lose. For example- I was loosing hopes because all of my squad members were dead and I was the only one alive then a motivational song played from my playlist and I finished the whole enemy squad",POSITIVE
I hate the ads but it's good and plus u can turn off ur device and it still work god bless please can u remove some ads maby at least 2 ads thank you,POSITIVE
Good for making playlists,POSITIVE
Great music app!!!,POSITIVE
"I've used spotify for the last few years and loved it, but the last few weeks have been clunky-songs randomly stopping and the music and plays when it says nothing is playing. It's quite annoying you cant adjust anything because nothing is ""playing"".",NEGATIVE
Best streaming service ever!,POSITIVE
I really enjoy the discover weekly playlist.,POSITIVE
Getting any kind of support on the app is not happening.,NEGATIVE
Great I drive thru the mountains with no cell service and listen to my music the whole way. 100% satisfied!!!!!,POSITIVE

I love the music options and dont mind the ads would give this app a 5 star but sometimes when im listening to music and it would turn it self off in the middle of a match or a tournament and restarts the music and pauses it forcing me out of my game just to turn it on again then when it switches to another music it stop again just annoying and would like to play my games with music on helps me relax be sides that its a good app,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify. Its the best thing ever. But suddenly out of nowhere my volume is all screwed up. Its ONLY spotify. YouTube, facebook, etc works fine, but spotify just sounds horrible and the volume is so low even when i have it turned all the way up :(",NEGATIVE
honestly it started good but then went downhill but you get what you get ig,POSITIVE
Been using Spotify since day one,NEGATIVE
"Aggressively asks for new permissions, insults you if you say no. No way to provide feedback or get support, even as a ""premium"" subscriber. A few years ago they wiped my collection of liked songs with no warning. Otherwise it's okay. I don't recommend ""premium"", all it means is fewer ads, you'll still be treated like dirt.",NEGATIVE
spotify is a really good app to hear music if you like to :) but they might not have all the songs you like.,POSITIVE
"Used to love every bit of the app with premium but the 'good morning etc' banner at the top with 'recent' listening activity hasnt refreshed in months now, their support page shows its been a known issue for a long time but still no fix. Every time I open the app its just the face of an artist i listened to once and didnt even like staring at me which gets me irritated again so I dont even like opening the app anymore.",NEGATIVE
Love being able to listen to music from the 1920s to the 2020s.,POSITIVE
"Songs don't play, sometimes app doesn't show the song being played just audio and it's very glitchy. Using it on OnePlus 8T+",NEGATIVE

I hate this update it make the playlist on suffle and i HATE IT,NEGATIVE
Greatest music streaming app besides the quality of files its perfect,POSITIVE
"The horrible bug has been fixed, finally. Other than that, I really like Spotify. It streams well, it has all the music I like, there are plenty of podcasts I like and it connects with the devices I have.",POSITIVE
My sibling and I both don't have premium yet I seem to get a LOT more ads than they do. I get ads maybe every two or three songs while they can listen to ten songs without a single ad interrupting it. This is incredibly annoying.,NEGATIVE
Can not download some of the songs that I want to add to my playlist but other than that it's ok,POSITIVE
"Great variety; interesting Pod Casts; easy to find music for any event, time, or mood",POSITIVE
"Is very organized, has lots to chose from, both podcasts and songs. Paying for Premium is definitely worth it!",POSITIVE
Very good app for music listeners,POSITIVE
I love how I can make my own play list.,POSITIVE
Just get rid of the Disney and all will be great for me and maybe more. I don't like hearing the same ads all the time. But you still get 5 stars.,POSITIVE
App broken with most recent update.,NEGATIVE
"This is a really good app, helps me relax but, not having premium literally kills me inside because instead of playing my playlist, I get suggested songs that 1: I don't want to listen to 2: Just let me listen to what I wanna listen to I don't want to give you money to listen to music when I can do that on a pc with youtube. Edit: just delete suggested songs for the love of god",NEGATIVE
Good use easy song,POSITIVE
"Awesome, fuan and easy.",POSITIVE
Spotify sucks so bad they just want to push premium and shove ads up peoples butts. youtube premium is a much better deal than spotify,NEGATIVE
"I always cut off promos before I start having to pay, most I'll do is 9.99 for a couple months. You guys provide hate content in podcasts, so you deserve no premium users or money. Remember the customers can make or break a company. You're free to have whoever you want, but we as customers, don't have to support you anymore. Lose customers, you lose profit. Simple. You'll profit as much as Truth Social and other clown sites. That's why ya'll had to turn to shareholders. They won't help you",NEGATIVE
DUSCUSTANG YOU CAN NOT CHANGE WHILE LISTENING TO A SONG AND YOU CANT PICK A SPECIFIC SONG IT HAS TO BE SHUFFLED,NEGATIVE
It was good in the begging but the random song thing ruined it and we have to pay,NEGATIVE
"My complaint is consistent with other people, glitches for months now and has not been fixed and no refund. For such an expensive service, I am not paying for a consistently glitchy service.",NEGATIVE

The app won't play my favourite songs,NEGATIVE
It keeps not playing the exact songs I want,NEGATIVE
Could you add a way to see old version of made for you playlists like discover weekly? Sometimes I forget to like songs before the playlist refreshes.,NEGATIVE
It contains too much ads... Sometimes it causes headache... That's why I ranked it 1/5...,NEGATIVE
All of the sudden it's now 6 skips per hour but prior i had no problem skipping songs or playing what I wanted.,POSITIVE
"I have always adored spotify! I pay for premium, but I must say the whole ""hide this song"" option is getting really annoying being right beside save and add to Playlist. I have accidentally hid songs I've been trying to save and add to playlist",NEGATIVE
It's an amazing music application. Its having all latest music.,POSITIVE
Great for older folks like myself.,POSITIVE
"The app is good but what bothered me was I can't download songs from the app in order to play offline when there's no data,, please do something about it , please!!",NEGATIVE
Awesome .... missing Joni Mitchell and a few others.,NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
My experience with Spotify is top shelf # 1 period point blank.,NEGATIVE
"I used to love this app, it's very relaxing & u can pick any song u want. But I'm very disappointed on the new update, it doesn't let u skip some part of the song & it also won't let u pick any song u like, it will just played a random song. I CANT EVEN PLAY MY OWN PLAYLIST CUZ OF THE SHUFFLE, very disappointing but I'm still hoping the next time y'all update this app, pls remove the shuffle thing & the part when it won't let u skip some part of the song. I hope y'all understand :)",NEGATIVE
"The app is good, but recently, when I wanted to unsubscribe from the premium plan, I was faced with one problem. When I push ""cancel premium"" I see that message: ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred"" idk how to fix this, there's no such topics on the forum...",NEGATIVE
"Its a good app for music and all but when you tell me ""half an hour of free music"" then make me listen to a playlist of songs you suggested me that i hate and you get 6 skips unless you pay despite you making me listen to this ear assault i dont get why i should rate this app any higher. If i search a song i want THAT song not some random song because i dont understand how i can go from listening to rap to you ""suggesting me"" binding by the lights. Fix or remove your song suggestions",NEGATIVE
Poor app only ads are coming in this.. waste of data. Very poor,NEGATIVE
"Despite being a new installation on a phone less than a month old, it has started having the same issues I was having on my previous phone. It will randomly stop playing and show 'nothing playing' rather than the podcast or song I have had on. It has also stopped showing the now playing strip, meaning I am unable to pause or skip, only stop and play. Closing the app and reopening doesn't help, uninstalling only works for a few days if I am lucky.",NEGATIVE
Nyc app I really just wish we could be able to download a couple of songs on the free bundle for those of us who can't afford paid,NEGATIVE
I love that I can lock the screen and put my phone in my pocket and keep listening to my favorite podcasts and channels.,POSITIVE
"I do lots and lots of driving and I love music, so that means I listen to a lot of music. Spotify is a great app other than the fact that they don't know how to shuffle. I have repeats all the time on playlist that I know are days long. It's quite annoying for me to click one of my playlists and have repeats within the first couple hours.",POSITIVE
I just want to be able to delete some of the songs that use to listen to because the person who made that song did something absolutely terrible and I don't wanna be able to look at their songs and remember what they did ðŸ§ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best I couldn't live without their music,POSITIVE
"The best music service I have ever used. Spotify Premium is the only way I listen to music. At first it is like a big box if your favorite songs, but after you start filling your favorites list, and selecting artists you want to follow, it will blow your mind.",NEGATIVE
"This is a great app! But only if you have the premium version, the free version is awful and I hate this app for it! Spotify sucks. DO NOT GET!",NEGATIVE
"Shearing my honest review,I am a story hunter, wherever I get it I just try to grab it as faster as I can,so this app does grt job to me.....I have been looking something like this,...So for me this is best",POSITIVE

I love Spotify plays all my music,POSITIVE
"keep showing really explicit content in the home, even when the filter is activated. cant remove the podcast section from home.",NEGATIVE
Love the app but only problem is that I'm a student and idk if I wanna spend on an app rn. Otherwise 30mins and like 1 min ad is pretty good for a free song player cuz YouTube has HAS soooo many Ads. Solid 9/10.,POSITIVE
Is a very good app is just sometimes when it say enjoy the next 30 minute add free in like 5 minutes is another add,POSITIVE
Amazing app coz it provides all songs without any difficulty to found them . ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
I hate Spotify. The app keeps adding songs to my Playlist that I don't want and won't let me remove them.,POSITIVE
Great but trouble removig songs,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is my go to music streaming platform. It's very easy to create playlists. Only two requests I have of Spotify on next update. Do the Youtube thing where you can add a song to multiple playlists at once. And, make Russian Doll playlists. As in, so you can make an ultimate playlist. Anytime I add a song to these playlists, it automatically adds to this other overarching playlist. That would simplify things a lot so I'm not constantly having to manage all my different playlists.",POSITIVE
Great app but yk the ads ðŸ¥². I really love this app and I've already recommend to my frnds. I dont wanna loose this app. But can please reduce a few of the ads please.,POSITIVE
Too many ads.,NEGATIVE
"Fix the bugs. Crashing, podcast episodes not playing after one another and the few times they do, jumping all over the place. Notifications for podcasts are either non existent or show up a week late. Music UI is clumsy and weirdly organized",NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify and use it incredibly often. However the mobile app on my Note 10+ has been a point of constant frustration since I downloaded it. I have issues with playback stopping for no apparent reason. The controls to pause/resume, skip, repeat, etc. sometimes just disappear from the notification center and in the app itself, along with several other issues. Spotify is great on Windows, but the mobile app on the Play Store has been less than stellar for the majority of my time using it.",NEGATIVE
App can't not open without shutting down my phone. I've tried changing my password restarting my phone removing Google smart lock redownloading the app several times and nothing helps. Does not open the app at all!,NEGATIVE
"Needs a Lite version - takes up A LOT of memory and space. Downloading, (premium feature), is very cumbersome - you can't even download a single song without adding it to a playlist first. Free version if you click 'no thanks' to watch an ad they play a longer one. Once I find another option for podcasts I'll cut myself free of this app.",NEGATIVE
Nice app but premium adds are not good,NEGATIVE
Best music app I've ever had!,POSITIVE
Its kool with no comercials but it gets lost puts you in music your not playin plus whem your playing music sometimes it sounds like its spitting at you spotify aka spitifyðŸ¤£,NEGATIVE

"Amazing app, overall, maybe could try to get some more songs :>",POSITIVE
Good music and podcasts. Easy to access and use.,POSITIVE
Not able to login in any way,NEGATIVE
"This is my main app for streaming music and I've loved it since the beginning but lately it just stops playing. I've closed all my apps, I restarted the app, my phone is about a year old flagship samsung phone so it's not the hardware. I have the individual plan and pay on time. I don't know why it cuts out but it's becoming annoying.",NEGATIVE
I love my Spotify premium family plan! I like making my own Playlist and the suggestions Spotify generates are many times spot on,POSITIVE
Too much irritated adds,NEGATIVE
"It has been working really well for me, you can set it up to play the way you want it to , i be using the sleep timer at nights i love it!",POSITIVE
"I have been Spotify user for about 5 years now. I love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars. ""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change.",NEGATIVE
"Lot's of adds, that collapse mind while hearing songs.",NEGATIVE
Useless. Keeps skipping to the next podcast after a couple of min.,NEGATIVE
"Well I like to know that I can simply open my phone,and go to Sportify and be entertained! listing to all genres of music.",POSITIVE

"Terrible experience onmy S10+. Keeps cutting out, and when it does play, the now playing widget is nowhere to be seen in-app Update: I upgraded to the Samsung S22+ and the issue persists. The pulldown widget stops functioning before the audio cuts out, and it just says ""Spotify is Trying to Play""",NEGATIVE
After years of having a free account I have decided to get a premium subscription and I will never go back. I use this app for hours each day and it works well. Only issueI have is some of my liked songs will be unliked or become duplicated in my liked songs playlist.,NEGATIVE
Love â¤ ðŸ˜ ðŸ’– this app follow almost anything you can think of brilliant,POSITIVE
Spotify is affordable and has all the music you could want...but MY GOD IS THIS THING SLOOOOOOOOOW! The app frequently decides to close completely and getting it to start takes forever (you could literally wait a minute before it loads and allows you to play music). It boggles the mind that a company this big can get things so utterly wrong ðŸ¤”,NEGATIVE

Gives me all the music I have lost and those I never thought would discover again...great App worth having it,POSITIVE

Fine efficient and gets most of the music I like.,POSITIVE
"So much I like but LOSING NEIL YOUNG because he simply wanted folks to get accurate COVID info is unforgivable. Ratings/$$ over people's health & safety? Shame on you Spotify! That said, Spotify's layout is easy on the eyes. The fonts, crisp album covers & how info is layed out on each page simply looks great!Adding the song lyrics? I love it. The system itself is very user friendly. The band/artist selection is HUGE, and their recs are awesome, allowing me to find new bands.!",POSITIVE
This is the best app. You get all the recent songsðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Best music platform by far. The suggested songs and playlist are far better than any other platform.,POSITIVE

It's all good until you get an ad then another then another. They are a bit annoying. I know you need them but maybe limit it to one ad and not every 5 mins please. Thank you,POSITIVE
"music quality is good, but on mobile there are just too many ads to the point where it forces you to buy premium. i remember before there was only like 1 ad every 2-3 songs, but ive had instances where ive gotten 15 ads in a row after one song and then another 15 right after its not even funny. this also happens before playing any song on mobile.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is GREAT, without ads so i got premium. What the sayin once you go black you never go back well it's the same for premium like you are not gonna miss them like 1 min ads like it interrupts the vibe like you all turnt and stuff and then you hear a ad talking about if you watch the ad its 30min of no ads which is misleading because it's only like four 3 to 2 min songs long which I hate I just love being able to pick which music I wanna listen to so if you get spotify I 100% rec premium",NEGATIVE

Many problems but gave 4 stars cause i can listen to kpop songs and you recommend me good songs of my choice 1. Not proper lyrics in tamil 2. Does not have lyrics for all songs And 1 feature I like is that the app has Korean to English translation but I have seen this feature only in Alcohol free(Twice) song....

The issues started with music stopping randomly is I open another app/turn my phone screen off, as well as having issues connecting it to my sonos speaker.

"Too many ads. Just ridiculous. One ad= one song, again one ad= one song",NEGATIVE
"I listen to 8+ hours of music daily. I have had Napster, Pandora, and Spotify, and I am most pleased with Spotify. The breadth of available arists is impressive. Choosing favorite artists' radio stations allows me to navigate across genres and find new bands to enjoy. Downloading material for offline use is easy and it prevents burning through data on the road. Podcasts work seamlessly. If you're a music enthusiast, get off the banal radio and get a world class service like Spotify.",POSITIVE
Always problems with this app,NEGATIVE

I advise you to download this app .. you will definitely like it",POSITIVE
"I like it, but the only reason why I rated this app only 4 star is because it has too many ads, that is really intimidating.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify because it's free to use. (Recommended),POSITIVE
I've using Spotify for like more than a month and I will agree that it's a good and highly recommended app. Ads- totally fine and i still enjoy listening (no premium). This past week I'm having a several issue; when I play music it suddenly lags and crash out of nowhere.,NEGATIVE
Love that you can choose the music you want to listen too,POSITIVE
Best App for Listening Mp3 Songs.,POSITIVE
Too many ads before like at least a week Spotify had a lot less ads compared to now,NEGATIVE
Really liked the app. I mostly use it for podcasts. But lately it crashes everytime I start or resume listening to podcasts. I just updated the app and im looking forward to see if it got fix. Could also just be my old phone. I hope Spoftify eventully integrates comments on podcasts too. I think it could benefit creators as well as consumers.,NEGATIVE
Used for around 4 years now. This app is too good.,NEGATIVE
When i open spotify its just stuck on the logo screen(means the screen right after opening spotify). Please fix it,NEGATIVE
Best app for music With the best playlists,POSITIVE
Best app for music lovers but there are many errors in spelling of lyrics,NEGATIVE
"The app allows you to listen to music for free but there's also a cheap monthly subscription which only costs five euros here in Serbia. There's also family plans and duo plans which are for two people. Premium mode allows you to download songs for offline listening and it's great when you don't have access to internet. The free mode has its limitations, though, and you can only listen in shuffle mode. Songs also have lyrics which are synced in real-time so you can sing your favourite tunes.",POSITIVE
Every update requires that I reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app. Stop making things that already work worse!,NEGATIVE
Just love it. No more painful searches,POSITIVE
"Add a Feature in Downloading Music in Cellular and Not even if not Subscribe in Prenium and About that, maybe it should be more affordable in choosing of the any of it and include some feature if not online in offline.",NEGATIVE

"The app is good,but without premium is just mid. You can't listen to songs and you have to look at ads in every 30 minutes. But if you buy premium is actually good ig",POSITIVE
I like that it knows the type of music I like and offer good suggestions on discovering new music,POSITIVE
Why my Spotify keeps on cutting out everytime why,NEGATIVE
"Great App, but sometimes it lags.",NEGATIVE
"Good marketing strategy on ads which intentionally leads to use or listen to this app 30 mins. The next 30 mins. After an update or long break for usage i am unabke to open the existing account this is my 3rd account.â˜¹ï¸ðŸ‘ŽBut still i am using this app because UI is good, otherwise i would change..",POSITIVE

Keeps taking my money and not giving the upgraded features!! No way to speak the customer service.,NEGATIVE
"I thought at first Wow what an amazing app so much better than YT music. But oh wait this morning I went into the app and it said ""your 14 day free trail has stopped"" WHAT I DONT EVEN HAVE PREMUIM! Now it has ditched all its good functions - example - ONLY 6 skips per hour, Can only play specific songs. The dumbest app ever.

"Love this app!...great music, great selection, awesome!",POSITIVE
Easy-to-use and huge selection,POSITIVE
"Stable and easy to use with a vast library of music across multiple genres as well as many of the more popular podcasts.

There is a problem there. We can't download songsðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"Yeh the update is trash. Why would i listen to random songs if i was picking a song in my playlist? I pick a specific song in my playlist, pressed play, and a random song started playing. Which is a ""suggested"" Song. Bro just let me play my music. Just add the ""suggested song"" somewhere else than making someone angry. Just nah.",NEGATIVE
Spotify runs ads on premium and if you cancel your premium while you have time left on premium spotify will overwhelm you with ads about staying premium. It also crashes constantly and reset your listen time on podcasts regularly,NEGATIVE

Search in vain for a stop or exit button? Nope. Cant find anything. Uninstall app until you want to use it again, then reinstall? Yep. Only thing I've found that works. Now also adding the frustration of no way to rewind a podcast if you miss a few minutes and want to go back and hear it again. Have now uninstalled for good.",NEGATIVE
Ads is over inthe app stop first ads just a music player no ads player okey,NEGATIVE
"the non-premium experience is horrible to the point of that it should not even exist. If you dont want to spend money on listening to music then literally use any other platform and steer clear from this. You should not support this business practice. If you dont enjoy using the service please uninstall the app, it really goes a long way to hurt the company",NEGATIVE
"Unfortunately mobile app doesn't work for me at all. Can't find music to play, all playlists are empty and even suggested songs from Home do not play. I have a Premium account and all. Works great on PC though.",POSITIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"Spotify give me Always Running from Teyarch and Malukah and I will pay you money. This is an outrage. Also, I still can't filter different albums/artists. Double outrage",NEGATIVE

They have all my favorite music and some interesting podcasts. The sounded is great and even though I don't have premium the ads are not long.,POSITIVE
One of the best applications for songs,POSITIVE
"I swear its too restricting, spotify was a lot better before the update.",NEGATIVE
Non stop problems with app crashing or it just starts skipping songs and podcasts. Also after you listen to the ads it will glitch and start the ads over again several times. If it wasn't for Joe rogans podcast I would have given up on this app a long time ago,NEGATIVE
The algorithm us just perfect. Im addicted to it.,POSITIVE
Everything in this app is okay but ads are the major issues .. I m not saying to close it but decrease the timings ......,NEGATIVE
"Its better than wynk or gaana , it has the best playlist",POSITIVE
Idea- your organization should make where it only shows ads after you run put of skips.,NEGATIVE
I like the app very much... Good for listening songs &have a good quality of sound ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
"Showing offline while using spotify in wifi. My wifi is not the problem. This issue occurs when i try to play music from a downloaded playlist. Spotify comes back online when i switch to mobile data and goes back online when connected to wifi. But the funny part is that i can listen to songs from my saved playlists even though it's shown offline. Upon checking online, many people are reporting this issue for Spotify. Please rectify this ASAP.",NEGATIVE
It's a good app. But I couldn't download my playlists despite that I paid for the premium version. Still don't know why.,NEGATIVE
Its really good for listening music,POSITIVE
"Poor performance app does the hell what it likes, constantly reinstalling the frigging thing.put a question to Spotify never get a answer back, just keep taking the money guys but,spend some on development aye.",NEGATIVE
"I can't buy premium mini, it always appears unable to connect, even though the signal is good.",NEGATIVE
Keep getting random songs that are not even in my liked playlist is so annoying,NEGATIVE
I used to have the problem with having to wait for the skips and not being able to skip to my favorite songs so if yall don't want that problem just get the account modded version,NEGATIVE
I like IT and the bass is so powerful,POSITIVE
Always Advertisements i will install this app,NEGATIVE
"I like that most of the songs are here and playlists are so fun to make, i don't have any problems on it in web chrome computer...!!

I can't even view my friend's playlist description fully :;(âˆ©Â´ï¹`âˆ©);: Please don't make shuffle the only way to play the playlist please!! Oh and also, why do I need to be in college to get premium!? TOT",NEGATIVE
"Easy to navigate, lyrics are available...",POSITIVE
It has a lot of song but sometimes it glitches out,NEGATIVE
Screw your premium I just want to listen to music,POSITIVE
Love it! Awesome features and nice to use for music in my car,POSITIVE
Ukkkkkkmmmkkkkkkkk to get to get to get a good idea of a sudden change 3D hardware and to have you heard about it in my interest to have the time and I have you ever been a while to respond with a sudden and to respond as promptly and I have you heard about it but it's also possible and if there was no answer to respond with to have you ever get the best way is Essex junction box office to have the best regards John to respond as promptly to get a yn se udghoshak ge keep particular punctual uÃ¶Ã²,POSITIVE
If you buy premium you will recieve no add but if you use it for free there are songs between the advertisement ðŸ˜‚,NEGATIVE
The best app ever in music the sound quality of music is just amazing literally don't have words to explain ply try this once a moment only have one problem that's the amount of subscription for premium is high so please...... by the way left all the things are best....,POSITIVE
Spotify as we all know was great. WAS up until this new update I can't pick songs and I thought picking a Playlist would work but nope songs I didn't even add are on it. I didn't even know this update was a thing up until I got a new phone cause on my tablet and laptop I don't have to worry about this. Literally the only reason people use Spotify is to avoid this. If we wanted to not know our next song we'd use Pandora,NEGATIVE
Very nice music app like it,POSITIVE
It's a fine app. One complaint is I can't put a sleep timer on during an ad.,POSITIVE
Great app for music!,POSITIVE
Easy access to found favorite music,POSITIVE
PLEASE ADD: option to add whole playlists to Queue after 4yrs this is the only annoying thing!! *** If paying subscription fee of it is 100% advert free (adverts drive me insane!!!)& you can play your music in the order you like. You can also put your songs into a queue which is easiest to do when you want to listen to a whole album as you just click on album cover & then click add to queue however it is way more time consuming if you want to listen only to particular songs and / or playlists.,NEGATIVE
This is good AP I have ever use but their are some gilch so Spotify have to fix it,NEGATIVE
Great...many thanks that I can listen here to the best classical music!,POSITIVE
"Same problem as everyone else using the free version, they've updated Spotify to force people to pay up or go home.",NEGATIVE
Its a shame how many bugs Android users are facing - there's nothing more annoying than having to reset the app everytime the playing bar disappear or when it just pause randomly. The worst thing is that I even pay for this...,NEGATIVE
IM TRYING TO MAKE MY OWN PLAYLIST BUT SPOTIFY KEEPS PUTTING SOME SONGS IN MY PLAYLIST I KEEP TRYING TO MAKE A NEW PLAYLIST BUT ITS NOT WORKING I JUST WANNA MAKE MY OWN PLAYLIST PLEASE FIX THIS IF YOU DONT FIX IT IM FINNA DELETE THE APP,NEGATIVE
5 ads before I can listen to one song,NEGATIVE
"Great music quality, very polished and smooth app and is easy on the eyes! ALSO MAKE PODCASTS LIKE ABLE AND REPEATABLE!!! Other than that premium is very recommended if you can afford it.",POSITIVE
"Great for the first two songs but then a random song pops out from no where the song also is not on my play list. Please get rid of this Spotify. The song was called me and yo mama, that's the name this song came out of no where. then ten minutes later i have yet i listen to my play list. Then thirty minutes later i get one song one my play list but after just more random songs. Please Spotify Please remove this.",NEGATIVE
What is with this update- I also suffered the same thing everyone went through here. What-,NEGATIVE

"This app is just amazing We can listen all types of songs there And also of our fav artist like BTS,Neha kakkar,arjit singh,blackpink etc I love this app very much purple you ðŸ’œ",POSITIVE
One of the worst app i have ever used. Even though I had a a wifi with good internet speed but my songs just buffer and buffer. My eqilizer is turning off the second I leave the app. It's getting worse day by day and the amount of adds they had put between the songs are overkill. After every 1or2 song's there is an add. Deleting this app.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify it's my life I wish I had premium though it would be soooo much better but I'm broke lmao ðŸ˜­,POSITIVE
When i Click an song it shows different song its annoying I hate it Worst app i have installed tbh,NEGATIVE
"Inspite of using the premium version, you can't see all the song in one simple list when you type the name of the artist. It's so inconvenient to look for songs album by album. Horrible UX",NEGATIVE
Great Music Service App.,POSITIVE
They solved my problem after mentioning here thankyou Spotify,NEGATIVE
This app isfree music videos fancing too much latest songs this app has ads problem this app very easy to use,NEGATIVE
"3 songs 12 adds, I understand theirs premium but thats a bit much for free users. A Song is around 3-5 minutes each, 12 adds is 6 Minutes, I had 2 Songs worth of adds. And how often is the 30mins of no adds as I would think after 12 adds Ishould get that.",NEGATIVE
I liked it when I first download it I could fast forward or go back in the song and when I looked at the song I could play that song now I can't even get the song that I want when I click on it I get a whole different song and there's ads now and I can't even fast order or go back and when the songs over I can't even go back to the song,NEGATIVE
"PLEASE let me, a paying subscriber, remove the constant suggestions for podcasts. I must have accidentally started playing a podcast and now all I get is relentless push notifications whenever that podcast and similar ones I have equally no interest in have new episodes come out. Please let us, the user, have more control over what is forced down our throats.",NEGATIVE
Its been pretty easy to use but there are some songs that are not on spotify that i want to listen to,NEGATIVE
It's a great platform for streaming your favourite,POSITIVE
"I'm now having issues with every song I play pausing in the middle of the song, it happens a few times per song too. Very annoying when your trying to exercise to music! What's going on Spotify? I don't pay for no ads to have the music pause for a few secs each time. Might be time to find a new music app.",NEGATIVE
"Continues advertisements comes in the middle of song, not even able to listen one song property, whenever I wanted to change the song there will be advertisement plays. I know I have to get premium for avoiding ad but it's very useless without premium",NEGATIVE
Has everything perfectly at the tip of your fingers. Why go elsewhere,POSITIVE
"This app just to be fine With the latest update I keep getting disconnected no matter how close I am to my modem or how many signal bars I have, interrupting my songs 2 to 4 times per song. I can't even see what I am playing on the notification bar on android and I have not figured out how to see what I am playing in the app. This app just to be so intuitive and easy to use and now it's riddled with issues.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing app, best best Im fed up with jio savan , there is lots of add... I like it very much Spotify Love love love",POSITIVE
"It's good for playing music, but when tracking pocast episode it's a nightmare. You have to scroll down so far if you accidentally add a unplayed episode to the played one. The filters doesn't really help in navigating. I think it could be better",NEGATIVE
Great experience with the app every music and artist is available for your liking,POSITIVE
It has too many addsà² à²—à² ,NEGATIVE
YAYYY IM SO GLAD THEY ADDED BACK THE FEATURE I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY EVEN IF IT HAS ADS,POSITIVE
WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE A PLAN WHERE I COMPLETELY PAY FOR EVERYTHING ON SPOTIFY INSTEAD OF PAYING IT MONLTHLY WHAT IF I FORGET TO PAY IT!ðŸ˜¤,NEGATIVE
This app was not doing what it supposed to do it's not playing songs.Some songs are not being played,NEGATIVE
"Love the app, works great, never had any problems ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
This app has become really really bad. Keeps saying I have no internet connections which I do. Sound does not sound good on certain albums.

It always says I'm offline even on a super fast network & search doesn't work. It makes the app useless. This started in the recent builds from last 10 days or so Apart from that Amazing app. You have the fastest streaming service I have used really amazing. These feature requests look to be done 1.Reduce the amount of space it uses in my disk. 2.Genre playlist which plays songs in all languages in that genre Thanks for that.,NEGATIVE
For a subscription service. Why am I listening to commercials in podcasts?,NEGATIVE
"I liked the app until the newest version. The older version in my opinion better. 6 skips an hour really? The songs that get added to the Playlists are the most annoying, they never end. Before i would rate Spotify 5 stars but this, it's not something i have seen anywhere.(sorry for wasting your time if you are a normal person but if you help Spotify tell them to fix this. Im not the only one here that wants this fixed too.)",NEGATIVE
Can download songs for offline playing,NEGATIVE
I love this app but I wish some artists were available to stream such as Atheist. As a big metal fan and music fan finding out some songs and artists aren't available to stream sucks. Please Please please allow these to be available,POSITIVE

"I'm not sure what the recent update has done but it now stops randomly, which, is super convenient for me, but dangerous if other people are experiencing this on the road and attempting to reopen. I appreciated some features of the new update but it seems to have wrecked the app - this is faster than providing feedback to customer service. It's June 26, now. Y'all aiight? Blink twice if you need help.",NEGATIVE
My app is installed and now it's saying no internet connection...... What's the matter?,NEGATIVE

"If i could give zero stars i would This app is a piece of garbage ware on Android extremely poorly optimized constantly deleting my downloads and slower then molasses, its not because i have an older phone because well i don't i have an lg g7 thinq and when i first downloaded this hot garbage of a music app and payed premium in 2018 it was still bad and they have had almost 3 years to fix it and they haven't -10/10 Update I got the new google pixel 6, love the phone, Spotify still runs like s***",NEGATIVE
"I absolutely adore this app. I've been using Spotify for roughly four years now, and I've had minimal problems with the app. I believe that using it on a phone is the best experience, but I've relied on the web player and honestly have only had a few problems. After inspecting their website for answers, I resolved the issues by running diagnostics and such, and never really had problems again. I very much so recommend this app, especially when you use their premium subscription.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify so much I would have gave it a five but you already know its the adds but i really dont mind then because i have remebers them all word by word but on my liked songs random songs that are on my dont like pop up,NEGATIVE
Hate the ads,NEGATIVE

"One star review because I can't play my favorite music without having some difficulties like let's say I would love to play ""build our machine"" by dagames but when I do, it just brings me to a useless album that doesn't even play the music I want to listen to and when I add music to my favorites playlist, it doesnt even play the whole song only a short 5 second clip of that song but when I play other music, it works like what and the shuffling oh my god who the hell cares about it? Just fix it.",NEGATIVE
So many ads so I give only three Stars,NEGATIVE
The only bad part is the ads,NEGATIVE
Variety and awesome music,POSITIVE
It's a great app to for music and podcasts. There are a lot of ads but they aren't after every song.,NEGATIVE
Works flawlessly. Can find anything imaginable for songs including foriegn music.,POSITIVE
The widget doesn't work anymore and I always use it! Please try to fix it :(,NEGATIVE
Incomplete list of album of some artist especially Local artists.,NEGATIVE
"Having been on spotify for as long as it's been available in my country, I find its current state discouraging. Premium plans are very expensive when you're likely also using up your mobile data (yes, download is a thing - but what of music recommendations? what of phone storage?), but the ads on the free plan are unbearable. In the past, you would get a 30s ad for 30m of music. Now, you get five 20s ads, two songs, rinse, repeat. It's ridiculous. Unusable if not for bandom/k-pop goal purposes.",NEGATIVE
"The best current music experience, across all platforms. I have only had a positive experience with the app, and it seems to always be improving.",POSITIVE
Have used Spotify for over 15 years now. Would never stop,POSITIVE
"I'm having so many problems with my Spotify, it's driving me nuts. I've spent way too much time troubleshooting and it still jumps to the next song randomly, stops after a few seconds of playing when it's through my Google Home or Android Auto, tells me it's offline when it's not...I'm close to abandoning it altogether.",NEGATIVE
I like the app and the music but I don't like how we can't do almost anything with out premium. Like I cant repeat songs and other kind of random songs pop in when I'm listening to my playlist.,NEGATIVE
App keeps self fast forwarding podcast. App turns my volume down every 15 min. 3 android devices has the same issue. Recent updates did not fix it.,NEGATIVE
Too many damn ads and useless garbage!,NEGATIVE
Seems to only play 30 second clips. Uninstalled,NEGATIVE
Bad app absolutely terrible the app adds STUPID songs to your playlist for NO reason,NEGATIVE
I give up on watching news during the day. I get up in the morning get a cup of coffee go outside in the yard before it gets too hot turn on Spotify and just crank it for about 4 hours a beautiful way to start the day.,NEGATIVE
"I use Free. I don't mind the ads, though they seem to have doubled recently so now sometimes it's 4 consecutive ads every 2-6 songs. I DON'T MIND ADS. So why can't I play an album without it shutting down for no reason; won't even allow you to play any album more than a couple of times? I'm willing to suffer ads and recommended songs but you deny me my album anyways? Remind me: what's the point? Otherwise a good app just not inclined to pay when I'm being shorted up front.",NEGATIVE
I love this app as it has all my fav songs,POSITIVE
"Enjoy Spotify, easy to use and find songs",POSITIVE
App keeps opening when I restart my phone. Not cool. No setting seems to address this issue and there was nothing in the support section. I don't care enough to log in and email for help so Uninstalling is all I am left with. Oh well.,NEGATIVE
"It asks me if i want to watch a short add for 30min of ""un interutpped"" listening i watch the add and 2 songs later i get another add.",NEGATIVE
Best podcast app out there,POSITIVE
"I'm very dissatisfied with this most recent update, no currently playing bar, doesn't even turn my playing song green, very inconvenient.",NEGATIVE
"The app doesn't seem to be able to play on any Sonos devices, either mine or those of other people that I used to be able to???! It's there a known problem?",NEGATIVE
I can find any song and love premium no ads rewind and fast fwd u can't beat itI,NEGATIVE
It always log out when my data depletes and always requires me to download the playlists i have already downloaded all over again. I'm done with this app!!,NEGATIVE
"Single handedly killing the music industry and yet I give it $11.99 a month. If you want to get depressed, search for 'love' and see 'all songs' .... You've never heard of any of these artists and you will never have the time of day to listen to all this music. I wish curating my playlist was easier: it's hard without the pictures. The web app is so slow. But I can only change the playlist display pic on the web app. Wish I could do that on mobile. Pay your artists, Spotify. You can afford it!",NEGATIVE
Always on point and convenient as a premium member I don't use anything else but Spotify,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify its just the ads are anyyoing. Also I love how u can find songs from tiktok on here and sped up songs,POSITIVE
Well its good but so far I had trouble with. Its doesnt want to open the albums I created on my library,NEGATIVE
to be honest this app is very useful for gamers for many reasons but i only hate in this app is the ads about spotify premium and im teenager i dont have credit card to buy the premuim account so please dont make us watch ads.,NEGATIVE
love this app. <3 but sadly in andriod you cant pick the songs you wanna play but in iphone or ipad you cant :'),NEGATIVE
The best way to listen to music,POSITIVE
"Really well thought out design, only problem I get is not being able to pick a song every so often otherwise, works fabulously!",POSITIVE
It's great clear music so far no ads,POSITIVE
Just a great music platform. Easy to use with an enormous collection of music and more.,POSITIVE
There is a wide selection of music but there is an add every 2 songs,POSITIVE
"Before when I wpuld create a playlist spotify would have 'recommended' songs that I had the option to add to the playlist. Now they automatically add them songs and no matter how many times I delete those songs, they just keep adding new ones. I used to like using spotify but now its just a pain in the a$$ with this new update. If I wanted those songs in my olaylist I would've added them myself.",NEGATIVE
I love how accurate the recomemended songs are and they turn out to be songs I never knew I liked. I highly recomend.,POSITIVE
Everything I need in a music app,NEGATIVE
"Doesn't work with Android OS 11, has 'something went wrong, try again'. Nothing plays and is now unusable. Please fix.",NEGATIVE
Such a interesting experience in music.,POSITIVE
After update. Unable to control with my sport gear 3 watch. Would give negative stars if possible. It is really that bad!!!,NEGATIVE
Missing play controls still... Is this a software/app or other problem...?,NEGATIVE
"Great, enjoying the audio books, great podcasts",POSITIVE
They fixed all the issues I had previously now it's in a very good state,POSITIVE
I just love the functions that r installed in it like if I can't remember the song name then I can write the singer or artist name and then all of his/her songs appears and it is ads free and free playlists and just one click to add in playlist not like SoundCloud where we have to listen the whole song first...but anyways I just love the app you should try this if u have interest in music ðŸŽ¶ or any thing realate to music...thank you âœ¨ðŸ’œðŸ‘ðŸ’«ðŸ”—,POSITIVE
"I literally can't get rid of my subscription, it's forcing money out of my account that I can't afford. How do I get rid of premium?!?!?",NEGATIVE
"Today I had to listen to 3 long ads (over a minute) every two songs for an entirety of a drive. How desperate and greedy can a corporation get. Oh well, back to mp3s we go!",NEGATIVE
Easy to play music,POSITIVE
"Andriod App is constantly bugging out and crashing. Stops playing randomly. Been having issues for months, nothing's been done about it. Requires a few restarts of app to work.",NEGATIVE
Love the ability to find obscure things that I can't find anywhere else.,POSITIVE
"I absolutely hate this app. The adds very very irritating. I know you are trying to force people to buy sprtify premium but enough is enough. Adds come almost after every 2 song. And not just one add, it's 2 adds. This is horrible. Trying to force customers into buying premium by irritating them while they listen to music. This app sucks ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼",NEGATIVE
"Spotify has helped me uncover the sounds that I hear echoing on the top of my mind.. and it has helped me discover new sounds, adding to that echoing sound of my mind..âœ¨ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½",POSITIVE
Pleasure to listen too. Nice music ðŸŽ¶,NEGATIVE
Endless Pleasure for the music lover in u ! I wish I could skip more than 6 songs sometimes you just want to hear only your favs why the need for control ðŸ˜Ÿ,POSITIVE
Very excited about music choices,POSITIVE
Love spotify â™¥. The family plan is affordable and the sound quality is always booming on my speakers. Everyone can hear when I'm coming down the road! I will never leave them.,POSITIVE
"As of late when I play music or a podcast there is no interface for what is playing. This leads to the fact that there is no way to pause or skip. So if I want to pause, I actually need to close the app now. Hopefully this gets fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Great app! Has the sickest jamz & tunez. Brings me to a better mood with my energy booster playlist ND then brings me down, when I'm in my feelings",NEGATIVE
"So great. Subscribed now. Best thing. Listening own playlist while reading, gaming, dancing, dating. The best. Up to date podcasts, music, Sigrid, Devon Cole, etc. Couldnt ask for more. I'm in.",NEGATIVE
I love the app as much as spotiq,POSITIVE
It puts songs that I don't have on my play list,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify,has all my favorite music at the tap of my finger tips.ðŸ‘",POSITIVE

Not excessive advertising,POSITIVE
Please reduce showing ads,NEGATIVE
This app it's awesome and it amp it you up.,POSITIVE
"Some kinda bug on it. It keeps randomly connecting to my echo dot which isnt even plugged in. It plays 10 seconds of a song through my phone then goes silent, spotify picks a random song... skips half way though then says its connected to my dot ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
"This is a good app and all but my complaint isnâ€™t really much. Every time I try to play Spotify songs and play something, the music just stops for some reason. It happens a lot and while games lag too. Other than that, this is a good music app.",NEGATIVE
"very nice app, however I don't know if it's just my phone but it will randomly stop playing music and pretty much refresh the app if I'm on a different app/game with spotify music playing which is really annoying and leaves me to have to go continuously back and forth from app to app to get the music to continue playing.",NEGATIVE
I have had this app since 2012. In the last week it no longer will download songs and play them offline. It's weird. I will be canceling all 4 of my accounts. I prefer YouTube music instead. I problem cleared up. I bought a kenwood stereo that has spotify on but will not properly connect not matter what I do. Apparently no one can. Wasted opportunity on kenwood and Spotify. Seems like everything is half-assed now,NEGATIVE
I don't listen to music everyday so i can't nitpick tecnical thing about this app m here only to rant about their irritating technique to force us to take the prime membership.....i mean come on man is it mandatory?obvsly no everyone know this .......then why make it sooo annoying by putting an ad after every single song......atleast give us 30min nonstop song as it was before that would be enough for us.... M not stopping u from doing ur advertisement but have lil bit of pity on us......,NEGATIVE
I enjoy that the ads aren't very long,NEGATIVE
Very good and nice app for music,POSITIVE
It so nice to listen to your own favorite songs and lyrics tooðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Has all good songs but it always gives me ""suggested songs"" its really annoying and i always hate all the songs they suggest",NEGATIVE
Great music application,POSITIVE
I listen to Spotify every day. Podcast mostly. I love that I can always find new stories. Very interesting. Keeps me coming back daily for more.,POSITIVE
Overall great experience but to many ads if you don't want to pay for premium.,POSITIVE
I can appreciate the ability to set up a bundle of music you can enjoy for hours.,POSITIVE
I've always loved this app but for the past couple of days it's been giving me issues it shows I have liked songs but when I click on the liked songs folder it says no liked songs I tried logging out and logging back in but that didn't work all I wanted to do was make a Playlist,NEGATIVE
"Grate service, still can't get sertin songs same as apple",NEGATIVE
Pay to win app basically. I can't play ONE song. Like it only shows a 5 seconds preview of how it sounds. I can't even listen to any songs on my playlists. There is no point it's a PAY TO WIN APP,NEGATIVE
I have spotify premium and failed to pay my subscription on time. I was given a few days to update my payment details before my premium expired and hence didnt lose my downloads. Thanks a lot for this!,NEGATIVE
It's free therapy ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸ besides the ads- ðŸ—¿,NEGATIVE
"I have the paid version of Spotify, and along with the YouTube-Pro app it's become one of my most used apps! For anyone still buying albums/singles on CD, give Spotify a try and you'll soon realise this is the way forward in 2022. If the ads annoy you, get the ""pro"" version, it's worth EVERY penny. For the cost of a SINGLE ALBUM each month, instead of just one album you get almost EVERY album ever made! Seriously, give the paid version a try! Without ads it's so much better! 10/10",NEGATIVE
Wish it would play on my watch when my phone isn't on,NEGATIVE
"The Equalizer can't be controlled but in iOS, equilizer can be controlled. Without equilizer the music experience is ruined",NEGATIVE
The best music app ever,POSITIVE
"I want to love this, I do, and on my phone it works great, on my laptop it keeps logging me out",POSITIVE
"Less data , more songs..",NEGATIVE
"My only place for music, podcasts, audiobooks.",NEGATIVE
Very quick and easy. Love it!,POSITIVE
"Absolutely love Spotify. The best 10 dollars a month I've spent. Everything has a choice here. Hi-fi or low-fi music. I have Bose cube speakers and using Bluetooth with an app for bass boost and equalizer the music is intoxicating. I have 100 Playlist and EVERY CD ever made is accessible here. Journey, Def Lepard, Van Halen, Winery Dogs, Alter Bridge, Slash, Seal, etc. Sounds amazing in hi-fi. MUST use an app for equalizer and bass boost. Thans Spotify. I never have to buy any cd",POSITIVE
"I really did like this app, but then they added a preview update now its really hard to play a certain song, they also add random songs to your Playlist and it's really annoying so yeah.",NEGATIVE
"No one comes close. I live on Spotify and if you don't use it you are missing out on a must have subscription. Spotify is like the Amazon of streaming music, podcasts, concert hub, artist info and merchandise links I can go on for ever!",NEGATIVE
Very nice app for personalized music. All things are sorted. I love SpotifyðŸ¥°â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"Has a vast array of Artists, albums and songs, many have the lyrics provided, many also have information on the artist's and their history. User friendly app.",POSITIVE
"Great app, but I should be able to skip as many times as I want and play whatever I want without have to pay for premium.",NEGATIVE
I feel like their should not ever be suggested songs it is so annoying and wastes your skips ðŸ™„ fix it and my rating will go to 5,NEGATIVE
Why do people always act this is a good app when it clearly is a scamming app used to scam people into buying premium so that the app would work but when people buy premium nothing changes and the user gets very annoyed and writes a complaint only for it to get removed so it can have a good rating and scam more people.,NEGATIVE
It gives me peace of mind.i play whatever music which comes on my mind,POSITIVE
Really enjoying the app so many albums I haven't heard in years,POSITIVE
Older version was better. Used to be able to access playlists from home screen. Now I have to search through the app to find what I want to listen to.,NEGATIVE
"From a free perspective the app kinda suck with all the ads and having to have internet. A premium perspective is very different, but you still need internet dispite saying you dont. I live in the middle of a wooded area so it's hard to get good service without paying an excessive amount.",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify!!! Everyday I'm listening to my favorite jams!!! Thanks for the enjoyment from your service...,POSITIVE
"Ok i don't have premium subscription but what does it mean..? It's almost after every single song, i have to suffer with add.. Too irritating and tired of this now..",NEGATIVE
"Unable to login and there is no option of retrieving password, while using the option of login without password many times showing ""error logging in. Try later""",NEGATIVE
"I love listening song,s on this app but one problem it have much adds but this is the best app and this is much better than gaana",POSITIVE
"You just deserve thatðŸ˜ I wish they added those ðŸŒŸ. Like 10 ðŸŒŸ, you just have to earn it. All what I wanted to listen in 1 place ðŸ˜ ðŸŽ¶",POSITIVE
Something went wrong Give another go Fix that. I cant use my 1 week premium.,NEGATIVE
it's so endearing without adsðŸ¥²ðŸ˜Œ,POSITIVE
The free version is great. Just make alot of playlists with a couple songs on it... (Will let you choose which songs you want to hear!) The ads are a little irritating though especially if you're trying to sleep.The paid subscription is very nice and will allow you to listen to most songs (all in the order you want) the only thing that would make it five star is a couple artist's albums aren't on it. Overall amazing.,NEGATIVE
"The music plays instantly with lyrics as well, that's super cool",POSITIVE
great a+ best free music even better when you hop on a afamily plan 3 Gold Stars,POSITIVE
"As a person with adhd, I cannot STAND having my playlists on shuffle. Please work on this issue ðŸ¥º",NEGATIVE
Great new music weekly. And if you download the music you can listen still offline,POSITIVE
Sometimes buggy when the playback suddenly stops and seems like the app is not able to use the internet of the phone and needs 2-3 minutes to start playing again.,NEGATIVE
Nice but I miss being able to download songs pls can I be allowed too? Ohh I realised the only reason I could download things was because I had premium,NEGATIVE
Lots of ad show inside the app,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify so much. Although I would like a customizable UI to make it better.,POSITIVE
Great app for listening to UT favorite music,POSITIVE
Love the app but the add are a big problem please do something of this adds,POSITIVE
I really like the various artists that I can hear and I'm thinking about upgrading.,POSITIVE
Thank you for the good music you have.,POSITIVE
Good up to date music technology,POSITIVE
"Too many ads, can't listen to one song with getting 4 to 5 ads after it no matter what",NEGATIVE
Finally I can listen to music published by my talented family around the world!,POSITIVE
"Great app keep up the good work although i dont really like the new update, I dont like that you cant skip back on a song and now it just randomly plays a song from the artist not the song i want also you can only skip 6 songs an hour change that and i'll give a better review",POSITIVE
"Ads every 10 minutes; random songs added to my playlist and can only skip 6 songs every hour... I literally can't listen to my playlist because I got over 6 ""recommanded songs"". I made a playlist, at least let me listen to those songs?? Trash app.",NEGATIVE
"went to listen to music, and found out that all my songs got deleted from my playlists",NEGATIVE
"Best spot for music, Spotify it! No unnecessary ads, only songs!",POSITIVE
Very fun and good app for music.,POSITIVE

Amazing there music is everything your want and it's no charge of pay ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE

Music cuts out. None of the solutions work,NEGATIVE
Good music and easy to find,POSITIVE
There was problem i will listing song than we automatically exit,NEGATIVE
when i try to put the songs that are on my playlist it puts on random songs that are not on my playlist,NEGATIVE
"I accidentally listened to a podcast I have zero interest in, and now I get notifications for it every time I open the app, with no way to delete, hide or remove it.",NEGATIVE
Worst lost of ad play one by one after one song ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Very poor integration with driving mode. Consistently plays random and erroneous songs when trying to make a selection using the voice assistant. Spotify pauses the assistant in driving mode when it's narrating outside of Maps. Issues reported time and time again. No fix in sight.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is awesome keep up the good work,POSITIVE
"It was good when I first got it, I could skip and go back but now my skips are limited and I can restart it. Im not paying to skip and choose a song. I'm going to a different app",NEGATIVE
"Been a premium subscriber for years, worth every penny. A new album comes out and it just alerts you, very convenient, easy to use, always awesome",POSITIVE
Love being able to find and listen to my favs!!!,POSITIVE
It's a very good audio platform I have ever seen. I can also create my own playlist in it.,POSITIVE
I love that i can leten to music and i enjoy it,POSITIVE
Very very good app for listening music,POSITIVE
"Aside from my account being regularly hacked and me having to remove people on a weekly basis hat i dont know,I have now lost all controls in app and on widget, no way to pause or stop, plays of you tap a song but still no control?",NEGATIVE
The sound quality is vary good The adds are coming in 30 min And many more things Nice work spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE

Everything is cool but hate ads..,NEGATIVE
Love Gracie's corner and the many podcasts available.,POSITIVE
I love listening to Spotify,POSITIVE
Good songs. Plays well. Repeats same ads back to back... not paying for premium so i expect ads not the same one over and over and over.,NEGATIVE
I just love music and it's easy to understand how to use this app!,POSITIVE
too many advertisements,NEGATIVE
"Just pretty great, I've got premium and its just lovely. My only real complaint is that sometimes I don't think the shuffle is entirely random but it makes sense why that is.",POSITIVE
"I honestly really don't like this app. On a phone, spotify adds songs to your playlist, FYI I hate the songs they add, YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE SONG without having to listen to a WHOLE PLAYLIST. SO much advertisements. Ugh i hate it so much. This is a scam you have to download premium to be able to do simple stuff like skip a song or listen to one song. It's literally just a scam for money, I don't reccomend installing Spotify",NEGATIVE
This app is not for listning song its only for listning dozens of ad,NEGATIVE
Enjoy my experience with great music,POSITIVE
This Spotify app is good. Keep up the good work.,POSITIVE
So far so good... I wish i can auto play the next song tho..,POSITIVE
Deletes songs every so often,NEGATIVE
Awesome but a bit two many commercials I don't mind some for free I expect it but it seems like there is getting to be to many,POSITIVE
Can you literally not add any songs more in my perfectly fine playlist?! Like let me enjoy the SONGS THAT I ADDED!!,POSITIVE
The app is so easy and fast to use I love it,POSITIVE
"30 mins without interruption thats a lie, I got commercials every 2 songs, super dessapointed",NEGATIVE
I have premium but its easy and has all the music I love,POSITIVE
I am getting too much trouble for login ..into app..,NEGATIVE
"Good selection of music and podcasts, terrible execution. Surprisingly Spotify, I don't what you adding whatever songs you want to my anxiety playlist and stopping me from skipping them. I get that you need cash so I can deal with the ads, but I shouldn't have to pay just to have free choice of music.",NEGATIVE
Very well composed allow at least 10 downloads.,POSITIVE
I used to love this app but after the new update I can barely do anything without premium. It gets really annoying and just makes me want to use it less. Either make it a 100% prescription app or just put it back to normal. Would have rated it five before this.,NEGATIVE
"Very good, it also gives the information about where the music is being played and who is using ur account and listening to which song and if someone else is using it u can control it by ur device",POSITIVE
It is super good! I really recommend this app. But why 4 stars? I love it but I think that it gives too many ads.,NEGATIVE
"From my phone to work to the car, seemless listening all day long.",NEGATIVE
They let us listen to whatever I want and I just love it!!!,POSITIVE
The play list created is fantastic. I really enjoy using Spotify,POSITIVE
"I've had no choice but to resort to streaming. Every conceivably convenient way of having music on my phone is defunct. Other than that I can say that it works, at least.",NEGATIVE
I like this site but if your going to play advertising don't play it over and over and over thats annoying. But other than that it's great. Only gave 4 stares because of the annoying add,NEGATIVE
Best music app i have ever used no cappðŸ™Œâ¤,POSITIVE
"It's really good to listen to music, but it is a pain to use. The app doesn't open most times when I try and I have to press library for example, multiple times and wait at least 30 seconds to actually open the page. And every time, it doesn't connect to the speaker, I have to open it again which takes a while, and then it connects. I'm on a galaxy s9",NEGATIVE
Now the app is becoming worse multiple ads are being shown at an inter wal of 10-20 mins,NEGATIVE
So cool to fiind all my favourite songs with ther lyrics,POSITIVE
"I enjoy using the Spotify app, because i can always find music which I like from many styles and sounds that I can listen to wherever I go.",POSITIVE
Great app excellent content plays seamlessly on my Android devices well worth the subscription,POSITIVE
"Absolutely love it! It's got so much music to choose from. I can get pretty much anything I'm looking for. From big name artist to local artist I follow here in my city. And a lot of podcasts as well. I haven't even tapped into any of the videos they have either because I'm listening to music or podcasts. I say give it a try if you haven't already. No contacts, no commitment. Always a plus.",NEGATIVE
Kinda BS that I have to watch an ad for 30 minutes of ad-free listening only for you guys to turn around and make me sit through FIVE ads after literally two songs. ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
Why is the Spotify not working well,NEGATIVE

"I love the app , it's filled with all my favourite songs but the ads between, i hate em. So, shove your ads in ur as.",NEGATIVE
One of the best audio apps in the ganr,POSITIVE
"LOVE IT !!! (exept from the free version that ive got) atverts every three songs.doesnt let you choose wich song to play. AND YOU HAVE ONLY 6, I REPEAT 6 SKIPS",NEGATIVE

"Fantastic variety--music for every mood, for travel, for meditation, for fun 'n' frolic!!",POSITIVE
"Worst app I've ever used. Constantly crashes, alwayd has connection problems even when on 4g and all other apps work fine",NEGATIVE
"It's a good app with premium but as soon as it runs out you have ads and you can't skip songs if you do it to much for a hour, A FLIPPING HOUR!! so I only really recommend if you can afford premium",POSITIVE
Never go offline. The app won't let you sign back in until you change it to online mode. Too bad you need to sign back in to change it back. It's such a stupid problem.,NEGATIVE
This is the best music player ever but sometimes I can't download music using cellular data but still it's a five star for me cause I love it ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
I like it but it would be better if all songs had substitiles,NEGATIVE
Songs were just stoped while using,NEGATIVE
I like the way it broadens my horizons with similar music. I I found Spotify through Last FM. Last FM kept dumping me into Spotify. What the heck is scrabbling?! Where is the tutorial. Learning curve wasn't as bad as I thought.,NEGATIVE
"all the songs are available and the sound quality also great, the data useage is less in the this app but the ads are awfull!!!!!",NEGATIVE

"Everything is exceptional with the app Only one thing would make it even better, a default playlist for all the downloaded songs",POSITIVE
The app is good but playing songs sometimes I difficult,NEGATIVE
"Mp3 songs best quality but 3 & 4 songs 30 second ads extra....,",NEGATIVE
"Worst experience, automatic advertisements play suddenly even if you you are not playing any song, merely installed went to office and it plays advertisements automatically.

Most buggy piece of software I'm forced to use,NEGATIVE
Music the universal language at my fingertips. Spotify is the backtrack to my visual Mindscapes,POSITIVE
Great app for music having a wide range but some features should be free Like replaying songs and non shuffle. (Free version) But overall spotify is a useful app for music offering high quality for a affordable price. (Premium),POSITIVE
"Best app for enjoying your on road ride and your idle time, dont search too many webistes, all in 1 place",POSITIVE
Well the app is amazing tbh great playlists i use it all the time but sometimes it has this weird bug where i cant see the song im playing or skip thru it (even tho i have premium) which gets suuuper frustrating especially caus im paying for it,NEGATIVE
Group session can't work properly!,NEGATIVE
Good song play!,POSITIVE

Everything is awesome . Although your premium is little expensive but i still have it. Myy only concern is when you guys gonna fix mic drop option. It will change Spotify totally . Its awesome. I tried once i dont remember it worked for one song . Now its useless,POSITIVE

Great music lovers appreciate it.,POSITIVE
Best music streaming service ever,POSITIVE
"Everything is good in this app... But there should be Suggestions option for hit and good music of any time, according to play preference of the users...",POSITIVE
Spotify on mobile is super trash i cant even change the music i want,NEGATIVE
"What the hell, spotify, I didnt ask you to add more songs to my playlist. You also took away tge ability to play individual songs and rearrange songs in playlists",NEGATIVE
Why can't I listen to a preview of a song before adding it to my playlist and why is it that everytime I try to continue my music from earlier it doesn't play the song til I skip to the next song and come back its really annoying,NEGATIVE
"When my playlist song is done, it started playing random suggested song and wont play back my playlist. It is annoying and I also recieve alot of ads after just listening to a song from my playlist",NEGATIVE
"This app is genuinely pissing me off. Can't listen to the songs I pick as somehow the app picks something completely unrelated instead. I'm not willing to spend money on features that I have for free on other streaming apps, but it would seem Premium is the only option for this app to even have a good experience. I'm uninstalling.",NEGATIVE
Favourite music App.,POSITIVE
After all these years I still can't delete the current song from the playlist that's playing without having to scroll through all songs (1000+) in the playlist to find that one song that's currently playing.,NEGATIVE
Lots to listen to. I use on long car journeys or while doing dishes or housework or outside pitting clothes out on the line or in the supermarket...Mr Ballan and The African Diaries are my go too but I listen to music and get spiritual inspiration and encourage there also. Pet peeve is that if I pick a music genre the app only plays the first 1 or 2 from my chosen artist or type of music. So I have to keep checking the phone and charging it back to my choice. That's pretty annoying& frustrating.,NEGATIVE
This is the best app for music. But I'm not able to listen to ANY of Badshah's songs.. like seriously.. it's been like this from a very long time.. but I'm fed-up of it now.. it's a really good app and this is the only app I use for music.. please fix this for me ASAP,POSITIVE
Amazing podcast for me,POSITIVE
Spotify is amazing,POSITIVE
"Have had pathetic experience of using the app recently. Even when I was logged in and all the songs from any of presaved playlist were played, app showed no internet connection issue while I used to search. For the very same reason I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well. But it didn't help. I hope the developers look into this as a serious concern. If not solved ASAP, users might end up with other music streaming platforms. Which I already have been shifted to and have uninstalled the app",NEGATIVE
Very bad app now a lot of ads and it get stops while playing songs but before the update it was really good and now it's no more good and i am gonna uninstall it,NEGATIVE
Love love love! User friendly and vast selection of music.,POSITIVE
An amazing experience of songs on Spotify.,POSITIVE
"It is more preferable app for musics and etc....but songs are not playing by single touch on song name...even sometimes like songs not displayed,,,,then I have to restart App!!!!!...",NEGATIVE
I have had an Enjoyable ad free experience with spotify's Premium Plan where I could play music offlineðŸ’Ž And stream my favourite music and DjsðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
Great at playing everything but the songs I want to listen to.,POSITIVE
"This app is the best .I just listened to all of my favorite songs .I like is, this is the best.",POSITIVE
Its a very nice and fabulous app that makes one enjoy music.....there 8s no need of filling phones with downloaded music....,POSITIVE
It's pretty good for listening to music but sometimes it can interfere with discord sounds. Spotify on phone is annoying because I can't choose the song I want on my liked list like I can with my discover weekly. Also why can't I shuffle my liked list on phone but I can't on my desktop. (Keep in mind I don't have premium.) The adds aren't an issue really. Spotify on phone and Spotify on desktop is two different experiences.,NEGATIVE
Very nice means for your favourite songs.,POSITIVE
The best music experience you can ever have...,POSITIVE
"Free version sucks, pay to play music version is my favorite music app.",NEGATIVE
Good app but add fre is premium .,POSITIVE
Great selection of music to keep everyone entertained,POSITIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"It's pretty good. But, after the new update, i actually become pretty confused. I can't play the songs i want, when i clicked the song, it's just a clip of the song. It keep playing shuffle, I don't know how to turn the shuffle off. Can you please fix this ðŸ¥º ?? I've searched on YT how to solve this problem, but, currently, there's no tutorial for this. And they said the only solution is you should move to Spotify premium. It's not just me who's struggling with this problem ðŸ™ðŸ»",NEGATIVE
Hands down best music app,POSITIVE
Started to crash anytime I try to play a podcast,NEGATIVE
Simply the best music app out there,POSITIVE
Spotify provides an immense range of accssessing music and podcasts casts.,POSITIVE
A premium Spotify member and I have issues with Spotify turning itself off or not playing whole songs and then starting up again. I don't feel like I should pay for something that does not work properly I've tried the tricks with logging out of everything and making sure the apps are closed instead of suspended. still doesn't work. Please addressed and resolved. thank you. If there was a app that gave me what spotify does without the problems and charged me more I'm would switch without a doubt,NEGATIVE
Does the job minus the ads but it's bearable,POSITIVE
Great experience I have been using this app recently alot It's great But sometimes the song I play doesn't play alot of issues have occurred I would recommend u to download but you network quality should be good ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Excellent stream of music,POSITIVE

3 stars cz i don't have money to buy premium ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‚,NEGATIVE
My absolute favorite music app! I just wish it could be a little more organized when you search things up or like with the podcasts and shows. There are also way too many ads. I understand they need them for it to be free but dang.,NEGATIVE
Still waiting for the day Spotify introduces Direct Message feature.,POSITIVE
I am having a great time with spotify. I have found songs long lost here. I love it!,POSITIVE
Good to hear from you and thanks for the songs and joy :),POSITIVE
Amazing app super sufficient i get all the music i wanna hear so time efficient too,POSITIVE
It is a nice app but if you haven't taken Spotify premium the add is going to suck your blood ðŸ©¸ litterly,POSITIVE
"spotify just randomly crashed on me today -_- pls maybe its just the day, its been weird since i woke up but this is annoying. lagging a lot, app keeps closing by itself and doesnt open, and it keeps freezing the screen and idk its just not working :< other than that its normally a decent music app, love that u can make playlists and they have a pretty wide variety of music so its all good when its working i guess :)",NEGATIVE
"Best & most Awesome App you can find. For international music there is no match for this app in India. Not just some songs-albums-lyrics since 1990s or 1980s, as a music afficianado you can get classics even till 1940s. There is even all recorded songs of Little Walter from 1920s, the 1st+only solo artist to be inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for Harmonica. Incredible range & quality. Also Lyrics for 90% of Songs. Top auto-playlist-recommends. Best free for few ads.",POSITIVE
Spotify has the potential of being the best music app ever but they only want money and you add ads between almost ever 3-4 songs?? Not to mention u cant take off shuffle or listen to individual songs on mobile but can only do it on TV or laptop which is ridiculous.,NEGATIVE
Horrible app you make a playlist and spotify decides to add in the worst songs imaginable you cant get rid of then you do it and it adds other gay songs hoorible app you cant even listen to one song by its self worst music app in the world you only get to skip a few of songs and then your band stupid app fix it for christ sakes,NEGATIVE
Good application for lovers of music,POSITIVE
Spotify is my #1 favorite application for music,POSITIVE
Works horribly. And what about the 30 minute break before ads? That surely isn't the case here,NEGATIVE
Need accurate song lyrics,NEGATIVE
"this used to be my favourite app - i'd use it every single day for way too long and rave about it. now spotify is just killing itself. the ui has gotten significantly worse, what with podcasts being continuously pushed in your face, and the extremely slow and buggy scrolling. i've been a premium listener for about two years, and my once astounding quality music has sounded dull, even with better headphones and many adjustments of the equalizer setting. that being said, i love this app",NEGATIVE
Easy way to find my music and podcast for a great price and best sound!,POSITIVE
Love it I can jam to one band of my choosing and any album of choice (the whole album) without any interuption!!!!!,POSITIVE
Love how Spotify always plays what I want to hear! And I love the lyrics section and the hand- picked Playlists!! Can't live without it!,POSITIVE
So far so good keep up the good job,POSITIVE
"When I got spotify first it was good till 2 weeks later it, it played diffrent music from the ones I wanted to play plus I can not choose a specific song and I have play it from the start and can only skip 6 times an hour and it limits what I what I was able to do.",NEGATIVE
"Only annoyance is when I get in the car and turn on Bluetooth, a pop-up shows up right over the Car Mode button asking if I want to connect to speakers, even tho it's already connected to Bluetooth. This pop-up can not be swiped away, and I just have to wait it out to be able to switch to Car Mode.",NEGATIVE
I'm happy that the app allows you to download podcasts but I wish you can download the whole pllist at once instead of putting each podcast one at a time which cause you to miss click without noticing. And since you can't custom your own playlist you would have to start all over with the downloads to get the right order. PLS FIX AND ADD THIS FEATURE!!!,NEGATIVE
Spotify music best song app,POSITIVE
"It's great, really. Though I can't play any of the recommended songs I want to add into my playlist. It kinda sucks because once i add most of them into the playlist. They aren't even my ""thing"" or what I'm looking for.",NEGATIVE
"I love this application,its most used app on my phone..",POSITIVE
"I don't really like the new update, I think it's unfair to only have 6 skips per hour cause it depends on the mood whether I wanna listen to it or skip it.",NEGATIVE
Very nice quality of voice,POSITIVE
"Excellent and easy to use via streaming to my Marantz receiver,great sound and large catalogue.",POSITIVE
"It's been a long time for me to heard anykind of song from this app(spotify), especially for korean pop song. Then suddenly, after my latest update for the released new version this app having overflow lacks for it's sytem. As instance: when i still play onto my music, the song stopped out of the blue despite my provider is stable plus there's no disruption either,and other lack in some feature which likely to much for me to write it all here. For world's sake, please develop it beter odeveloper",NEGATIVE
"So I've been a spotify user for over a year but the app currently logged me out of my premium account that I can seem to get back, everything on my account is not accessible in the app but only in the web browser. Is there any way I can fix this promblem? It's frustrating me",NEGATIVE
Hiding podcast removes it from home screen only for 90 days! That should be permanent,NEGATIVE
"I CAN'T PLAY SOME SONGS, it always says, ""Something Went Wrong"" and i can't liked some songs. PLEASE fix this!.",NEGATIVE
It's good . The only negative thing is the ads . The ads are mainly just their premium which removes ads but the only ad is the premium. It doesn't make sense,NEGATIVE
Awesome experience using the app. I should have downloaded it a long time ago. The seamless play with no adverts is it for me,POSITIVE
"Im on paid subscription but i can't keep this shuffle button off, whenever i play, it will automatically turn on. I uninstalled the app, clear cache and log out on all devices but it is still on.",NEGATIVE
"I Really Like What I Can Do, Like What I Mean Is I Can Make Playlist's & Not 1 Add Has Appeared. I Really Like This Thank you",POSITIVE
"Exceptional, stupendous,change nothing! You can improve on things if it's necessary as per me, i am satisfied. There's none like close to Spotify.The ability to play and replay music have put Spotify in a place where no other can attend or reach. In my world, all is Spotify 24/7 all year long. The opportunity to sing along declares Spotify the sole medium of music for me.I have the ability to learn the lyrics of my favorite songs and artists. All hell Bravissimo Spotify in my ðŸ›–.",POSITIVE
App is great just the ads are too annoying,NEGATIVE
I can't play the song that I wanted to hear it just shuffle into a different song that I never heard of,NEGATIVE
"i absolutely love this app, but it won't let me subscribe to a premium plan. i am a student discount beneficiary and everytime i try to subscribe through mobile payment, it only shows me the ""oops, something went wrong message."" i have tried troubleshooting several times but there has been no solution. i have been stuck trying to figure out this problem for a few days now. please fix this, i have been a premium subscriber for a year and this is the first that has ever happened to me.",NEGATIVE
Is the best music keep it up,POSITIVE
"its already been a yr n ur not even updating us, ive red the other reviews n we ALL have the SAME PROBLEMS! its not fair for us because we have to buy premium in order to unshuffle it? horrible service if u ask me. idc bout u updating the spotify, what we said needs to be done. not be ignored",NEGATIVE
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free,NEGATIVE
I love this app it has all kpop groups songs,POSITIVE
"How about instead of the ""We added"" part you just let me have my playlist JUST with what I added?",NEGATIVE
One of the best apps I downloaded so far. I get great use out of it.,POSITIVE
"I love it! I can't go to sleep without listening to some podcasts or playlists, but there are some issues.First you can just skip 6 songs an hour and it's just annoying sitting there listening to songs you don't even like. Next whenever i try to go to spotify the play and back and forward button are gray and wont even let me touch them, it will also say nothing is playing. Please fix this and no it's not my device because i tried it on others and still dosen't work. Otherwise i really enjoy it.",NEGATIVE
Excellent music suggestions,POSITIVE
"The app was really good until the latest update (06/23/22) , the layout is now confusing and everytime i switch to another tab the music is either choppy or cuts out. You need to pay for a bunch of things now which are very unnecessary. As a person that really enjoyed using spotify before this update i'd rather use youtube for my music, it seems like your getting a bunch of complaints from this update. I'd remove it before you loose spotify listeners too because im not paying for my music.",NEGATIVE
"Genuinely disappointed wanted to listen to the good the bad and the ugly instead I got some other song and couldn't even select it because I'm a free user, what a scam",NEGATIVE
For me I really enjoy it because I can access music that is not available on other music apps. They have a great selection of music and podcasts along with a great setup. The only thing that I don't like is that the fact that there is no offline mode. I enjoy listening to music on car trips but it makes it difficult to access anything because of it. That's the only thing about it that bothers me. Otherwise I highly recommend it!,POSITIVE
Being able to listen to most of my favorite bands albums is amazing and listening to it offline is even better,POSITIVE
Spotify is so annoying i wanna play my playlist/like musics but it goes to a different song like from suggested songs,NEGATIVE
Great way to savor your favorite hits.,POSITIVE

"This the worst music app ever. When you want to listen ""a"" song and they will give you a long playlist",NEGATIVE
I can't get myself out from the house or car this music is the best thing I ever need to get my situation going on with the music you have it is such a variety of Great music so keep up with the good music you guys I love it !!!!!!!,POSITIVE
this app is ok but adds sometime broke the perfect part but i love it tho,POSITIVE
"Normally love my premium but since the last update, if I have podcast and music on the same playlist. When the podcast ends, the music doesn't play like before. And that's very annoying it just closes the app. When I'm in a busy work day I'd like my playlist to play like it should. And not make me need to open the app again to select music. Please fix.",NEGATIVE
Please tell me how to stop the app from turning itself on as I'm driving!! nothing like music randomly blaring to cause an accident! Really opening yourself up to a lawsuit spotify.,NEGATIVE
60 second ad every 3 minute song.,NEGATIVE
Why do you add songs to my Playlist and I put them out but more come in please fix that if you could please do thank you,NEGATIVE
You should be able to make and sort a playist however you want.,NEGATIVE
Spotify could you make it so that we can see our song and playlist just that playlist busily before you updated spotify piz??? It was good the way it was before you updated it.,NEGATIVE
Getting more glitchy. Integration with HEOS is horrible and unstable. Please fix!,NEGATIVE
"I have a Premium Plan I use on a Samsung, but after the latest update I can't listen to anything at all. It tells me I don't have internet when I do. It tells me all the playlists are empty. If I look up a song, it won't play it. I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled. I have cleared the cache and data and then done all of those steps. I have done the ""clean reinstall"" steps. The only time I can get the app to function is if my SD card is not in my phone. Not a solution.",NEGATIVE
Worst never download this one U can try resso and wynk and other all but compared to all this is worst . It u didn't take premium membership 24Ã—7 adds i am getting 1min add after one song I request u try resso is better,NEGATIVE
I put five stars but if I have any issues then I wont hesitate to come back and GLADLY set it at 4 again ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜‡,POSITIVE
Easy to access,POSITIVE
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.,POSITIVE
"I avail a premium last 3 months, which i really enjoyed and didnt think that the subscription will be today, i didnt get ANY NOTIFICATIONS, that my spoti is ending, and it stole like $3 on my acc, not much but when u equate it to ph money, its like, 149.

Can't get certain songs but overall this app is great,POSITIVE
"This is one of the best app for leastining the song. In this app the haryanvi and Punjabi song lyrics are not in Hindi, its lyrics are in haryanvi and Punjabi. But the other app like resso any language song lyrics are available in Hindi, and this is the main drawback (demerit) of this app for music lovers. Thank you â£ï¸",POSITIVE
Works amazing and I'm finding songs I haven't heard in a long time,POSITIVE
My go-to streaming app. It's Spotify: what else is there to say?,NEGATIVE
"Used to love spotify until everytime I try to play my playlists, it plays other songs and I turned off autoplay and it still doesn't work. Spotify is only doing this for money",NEGATIVE
"Another broken update? None of the song radios work. Playlists I listened to yesterday now say deleted... All of them. Spotify works great and does exactly what I want 90% of the time... But if it doesn't work the first time, every time, it's not good enough. Don't push broken updates. Edit: you lost another star for breaking your app with bad updates. You've altered your algorithm and all the ""song radio"" are playing things things that are not the same genre and songs I've never heard of.",NEGATIVE
I gave this a low rating only because when I downloaded the app NOW it started screwing with my phone to the point where I had to delete it. The app never did it a year ago it just started and it is still the same phone,NEGATIVE
Very good mood settings..satisfied and approved!,POSITIVE

"(26/06/21) App used to be really good but now since the updates. it keeps telling me I have no internet connection, and wont let me search my downloaded songs. Plus payments have gone up and barely get any use out of the app.. as it won't let you use it offline even though you've paid the fee..hopefully this will be resolved soon. And it is still the same(26/06/22) if not worse I am wanting to cancel my memebership and use another service because of this rubbish",NEGATIVE
"I use premium, app crashes alot when i open it, seems to only do it for JRE podcast.",NEGATIVE
"I don't know what I would do without this app (although the shuffle feature needs a little work. I understand Spotify can see what I prefer to listen to, but I enjoy variety over listening to the same stuff over and over).",POSITIVE
The app used to work very smoothly before but now the app don't work at all . I am not able to play any music . It was an ugly experience for me . Plss fix this quickly .,NEGATIVE
Music keeps stopping. Very frustrating,NEGATIVE
Works great and tons of selection.,POSITIVE
Too much advertise,NEGATIVE
"It's a good app though but too much ads it's very distracting or frustrating you can't even skip an ad and have basic features but only exist in premium like downloading offline, listen to all songs simultaneously (I.G., every song is shuffle), moving the timestamp etc.",NEGATIVE
I really enjoy the company of spotify . Thank you so much,POSITIVE
Forces phone to restart when i open the app and download feature non- functional. I bought the premium mainly for the download for offline play feature but cant even download 1 song. Overall so slow and laggy,NEGATIVE

Every time the youtube TV add plays it repeats 3 times it's annoying,NEGATIVE
Ok it's good it has all my fav songs but there sould be an option to play a playlist in order or to just listen to a single song with out it going to a completely different song that is why I'm giving it a 3,POSITIVE
This is an exceptional music streaming service. The pros of going premium far outweighs the cons. I'm going to enjoy it very much but please bring back the anime tab on the discover page,POSITIVE
Awesome content with even obscure bands available.,POSITIVE
"No matter how many times I click my playlist, it only plays suggested songs",NEGATIVE
So amusing to hear music from your site without hustle of too much ad.,POSITIVE
I love this app! I pick everything from Patsy Cline to Jefferson Airplane and end up with hip hop!! Spotify all day long! Thank you for your app!,POSITIVE
Almost all the basic features of a music player--as basic as selecting a specific song to listen to--are premium only. The desktop version is fine but the mobile version is useless because of this.,NEGATIVE
I use the app literally daily. I have just one problem when I upload the playlist photo it will stay there until I close the playlist. Once I open it again the photo won't be there. Please let me know if there is a way to fix this. Other then that I love the app.,POSITIVE
My favorite music always.,POSITIVE
Best Music App!,POSITIVE
"Android app is trash. Like many other people, the app does not work with wifi. I have to disconnect from wifi everytime I want to use the app (and remember to reconnect to wifi when I'm finished using the app). Inconvenient and disappointing - especially coming from a multibillion dollar company.",NEGATIVE
"App constantly crashes. Personally, I have a hard time navigating. The list of recently played songs should be easier to access from your queue. My queue constantly clears when I accidentally click a song (when I may just want to go to the album or add it to my queue) but then when I try to start a new playlist, it will go back to a queue I had from days ago. Also very annoying that podcasts and music are all together, so it's hard to go back to your queue after listening to a podcast.",NEGATIVE
I have had Spotify for years and I love it. It is user friendly! I listen to podcasts on my way to work in the mornings and music at night. Best app ever!,POSITIVE
When I lock my phone the music stop until I pick up my phone again and open it how do I get rid of this feature ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
"Why am I even paying for premium? App constantly deletes downloads (yeah yeah, ""please clear your cache or try a fresh install"" is getting real tiresome), offline search isn't working, app is slow on startup, etc.",NEGATIVE
I got to enjoy my fave songs instantly!!!,POSITIVE
Been able to listen to music that I haven't heard for years thank you Spotify,POSITIVE
Reduse some ads,NEGATIVE
Love this ap. Better than pandora by far.,POSITIVE
30 min. No adds or interruptions is a LIE ! And why playing songs not on my playlist . If you were honest I would get premium.,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify as a whole - it has everything i look for in a music app. But constant issues with the functionality are very annoying. It stops playing and crashes all the time, the progress bar randomly stops displaying the accurate place in songs and podcasts, and sometimes doesn't connect to my Bluetooth speaker. I don't have any of those problems on the desktop app. Edit: 6/25/2022 and still having the same issues. No attempts to fix them whatsoever.",NEGATIVE
Great App wishyou could loop the song you want without premium.,POSITIVE
"It's great I'm not gonna lie I can pretty much enjoy listening to it while ny phones off. I gave it a 1 star because of the fact that I need premium for loop on,listen to the songs in order from my playlist,and tap in the song of what I specifically wanted. But the ad isn't exactly the problem on why I gave it 1 star due to it being common for me to encounter some. But point being this sucks without the premium and that I rather go back on YouTube then this.",NEGATIVE
"I can't play a song whatever way I want. I can't play one song at once and unless I get premium, I can't replay a song unless I play all the other songs on a playlist. It limits too much things.",NEGATIVE
I am really enjoy spotify app,POSITIVE
It is a banger to listen to music I know some say why can't u listen to any song u choose on your playlist but they have to make money after all,NEGATIVE
I love this app and trust me the premium is definitely worth it,POSITIVE
"Was good now it just doesn't work! Was fine last week then 3 days ago can't access anything on the app. Says no internet connection which is a lie as it's working for anything else. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logging off and on, restarting phone and still not working. Grrr am going on a long road trip and want to be able to play the Playlist I want. Can't even play recommend Playlist! Might have to cancel subscription!",NEGATIVE
Good music ðŸŽ¶ easy to find what you want to hear,POSITIVE
This app has become an abomination and is completely unusable now. Spent hours trying to figure it out.,NEGATIVE
Two average-length songs and more commercials. I'm actually keeping track. TWO songs. Not even TV is proportionate in it's commercial to viewing ratio.,NEGATIVE
Great app! just wish i didnt have to buy Spotify premium to listen to music for free :(,NEGATIVE
Great selections & playlists!,POSITIVE
Don't like it cause you need to pay money to just listen what you wanna hear and I'm not gonna be having 60 different songs to just listen what I want to hear,POSITIVE
Loved this app in the beginning. I could choose where I wanted my playlist to start off at... Now that you have updated the app I can no longer do that... On my tablet I have the older version of Spotify where I can pick the song that I want to start with... I just wish it was back to the way it was before this update that they had.... Still love the app though.,POSITIVE
Everything I need; my educational podcasts and favorite music,NEGATIVE
Internet connection often gets lost when i have full connectivity on other apps. Songs often fail to play. The home screen rarely updates. It takes ages to load albums that i have downloaded and saved locally. I pay $15 a month for all this disappointment along with a very comprehensive music library which is still rad when it chooses to work.,NEGATIVE
It's the best app in the store. Couldn't live without it.,POSITIVE
I don't have ads on Spotify I got premium and I've had premium for years and I will never ever go to any other streaming service for music it is the best streaming service you can find anything on there hands down the best music app ever.,POSITIVE
This is dumb it won't let you do anything unless you have permuim and it adds songs to my playlist that I don't want and I can't even click the song that I do want to hear and it's agrivating and annoying I can't play songs on loop unless I get premium I honestly think this app is only for people who can actually afford to listen to the music which is unfair,NEGATIVE
This is an awesome app its so easy to use.Ive been using this app for a while now but there IS one problem...when u create a Playlist they add random songs and play it which sometimes just ruins the vibe,NEGATIVE
So many freaking ads ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ,NEGATIVE
"I enjoy the app overall but I am giving 3 stars because the app constantly switches output device even tho I am not interacting with it. It's kinda annoying coz one minute I was listening to a song, next minute it went silent.",NEGATIVE
Great music until I only got six skips per hour. What is up with that?,NEGATIVE
Worst this app only 3 or 4 songs skip Advestament,NEGATIVE
Useless app. I had a free account for 3 months and never used it a single time. Just use youtube.,NEGATIVE
"App continuously stops when phone screen darkens on android, they are not issuing any fixes.",NEGATIVE
Spotify has always worked just fine for me just wish premium was free but hey Rome wasn't built in a day,NEGATIVE
Love it accept commercials,POSITIVE
"I have to say that I'm impressed! Put in my prefered artists, and the app made playlists that are exactly what I like! I've listened to over 20 hours of music, and skipped less than 10 songs. Well done! Well worth the price. Wish more apps worked this well...",POSITIVE
The latest update makes the app crashes everytime I open it. Needs to be relaunched everytimeâ€¦ :/,NEGATIVE
Love the intuitive play lists.,POSITIVE
"Offers free music of all kinds. Really an awesome app to listen to music anytime, anywhere. I have this music app for three years now and it's one of the best-if not the best!",POSITIVE
Worst music app honestly. Keeps logging me out almost everyday.,NEGATIVE
"Horrible horrible horrible ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I just wanted to listen to music, why'd you have to make me go thru all thatðŸ˜­",NEGATIVE
thank you a lot...for the music,POSITIVE
Great music library. I hope there was some option to change theme in the future.,POSITIVE
exceptional app.. the new version is amazing!,POSITIVE
Good finds most artists from most decade's,POSITIVE
"The app was amazing when I could scroll through my Playlist. But after the update I can't. You can shuffle it and stuff but you can't scroll though and pick your music, that's why I downloaded in the first place because I could scroll through and pick the song I wanted and it would play from there. I don't know if this is a me problem but it's really irritating me and I might have to switch apps. Please fix this as soon as you can.",NEGATIVE
"They added the feature to hide undesired episodes from your home screen on the cellphone, which was really good. But the feature isn't on Playstation Devices. Those frustrating ""recommended"" episodes still appear on my home screen!!! I've tried turning on Restricted Mode and hiding them from my cellphone but they're still on my home screen when I log in to the app from my PS4. It's so frustrating!!! I didn't even listen to podcasts and they recommended me 18+ stuff that I definitely don't want!",NEGATIVE
Just don't like it when the song stops and starts,NEGATIVE
Ad to music ratio is abysmal. Literally open the app and it plays the same 2 ads back to back okay thats cool then plays 2 songs and then I gotta listen to 6 ads? You're ads manager (whatever their actual worthless title is) should be locked in a room only listening to the ads. You're literally driving people insane till they purchase premium. Very scummy.,NEGATIVE
"constant ads. not only that but my mixes no longer give me the option to choose which song i want, now it's presented as regular playlists. how the hell is it supposed to know my music taste if i can't even choose what i listen to?",NEGATIVE
It sucks when I played a song it played a completely different song fix this now Spotify ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ,NEGATIVE
Good app for your favorite songs,POSITIVE
"Kept adding songs to my playlist and making me listen to songs that I didn't want to listen to, terrible app.",POSITIVE
You can search for every music you love the most,POSITIVE
I downloaded spotify to try it on my phone and its not lettting me play any songs its absolute garbage,NEGATIVE
It's cool. Best selection of music I've seen of all the services I've used.,POSITIVE
It's getting harder and harder to hear the songs I want without resorting to paying for premium. I'm currently looking at other streaming options because I'm so fed up with shuffle play.,NEGATIVE
It's just perfect... the best app ever!,POSITIVE
I personally use this app for podcasts and it's really easy to use. For music however this company doesn't seem to fairly pay artists on the platform and you can't play a specific song you want. You'd have to play a playlist and in creating a playlist spotify will sometimes mix in other songs that it decides are similar enough to other songs in your playlist. Just overall frustrating unless you're using it for podcasts exclusively like me.,NEGATIVE
This app is amazing I love it so much and definitely recommend it,POSITIVE
The best music app i ever had!,POSITIVE
No longer working with Android Auto,NEGATIVE
I have subscribed to premium and I have paid for 2 months already and still het adds and can't listen to music off line,NEGATIVE
please instead of shuffling through songs until we find what we initially searched for... make a play next button and let those other songs line up to play after the song we searched,NEGATIVE
What's up with the volume being too low on android auto? It's way too low.,NEGATIVE
"Very great app bought premium it worth it, even when I had to get rid of it I asked and then helped me un premium it was very helpful",POSITIVE
Amazing but a little more like YouTube ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Good when the app isn't broken. Constantly pausing my music isn't fun,POSITIVE
Just awesome they have every song that I wanna listen too,POSITIVE
This app is very helpful to play all legand singer songs. Thanku spotify .â™¥,POSITIVE
We really are enjoying Spotify.,POSITIVE
"Unreliable updates and changes. Please add useful features like pausing my randomized playlist, switching to another playlist and then jumping back into my randomized playlist without restarting the randomizer. Please remove one touch song playing. Very frustrating to scroll through a big list, accidentally touch a song and lose my spot in my playlist.",NEGATIVE
Everything I want to listen has been great,POSITIVE
I took a 3 month trial subscription but I can't seem to be able to use the app at all.. I have gone back to my older app for music after trying to run the app million times. My only concern now is that it says it will charge me after my trial ends and I can't find how to end my subscription. Very unresponsive team haven't had any reply from them on my last review..,NEGATIVE
Love it! Best Music app to have.,POSITIVE
The greatest place other than home (spinning vinyl) to play and hear music.,POSITIVE
Very very ads I request all my friends please ðŸ™ðŸ™ bring down the rating of this app. Because it contains lot of ads.,NEGATIVE
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.,NEGATIVE
"I have switched to YouTube music a while ago, and must confess I haven't appreciated this platform. Now I find it is much better. 5 star easy",NEGATIVE
A very amazing app. really helpful on stress full days,POSITIVE
The best music app ever,POSITIVE
"All I know is Spotify, its the only music app I would really use.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify working very bad connected via Bluetooth in the car! I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. Bluetooth version - 5.0, A2DP.... the music constantly breaks, stops and begins. Is there a solution to this problem?",NEGATIVE
This app is my fav but there are many issues to fix in means like in YouTube there is dawload video so when no network but fun.But there is no options for this or else this app is nice.,NEGATIVE
The best music streaming service I've seen. And I've used most of 'em.,POSITIVE
"Downloaded it , first few months 1 comercial for every 2 songs now I get 4 comercials per song. They Amp up comercials like crazy. Many of the comercials are for liberal companies like Facebook asking for more power to silence people and companies looking to diversify so no white people need apply to those I guess.",NEGATIVE
Annoying amount of ads Ads pop up every 2 songs Rest assured spotify is a great app,POSITIVE
Spotify is now becoming very worse it is playing adds for every two songs all time distance and also less sound for songs,NEGATIVE
Excellent songs to change the moods,POSITIVE
Great selection of tunes.,POSITIVE
Very nice app ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» works very nicely ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ less data consuping and I recommend everyone to download the app,NEGATIVE
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please.",POSITIVE
Outstanding service to me! My playlist will blow your mind OMG! ðŸ’œðŸ’œâ¤ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£,POSITIVE
I changed my long time five star review to one star because Spotify on Samsung is terrible. The update causes it stop working constantly. This review is from a premium user. Maybe it was five star before because I had an iPhone and spotify didn't constantly stop working. Now I have to force stop it in my phone settings anytime I want it to work properly. Whoever made this update really messed up. I hope you guys take these 1 star reviews in consideration because spotify used to be good.,NEGATIVE
"The app is awesome you also can listen k-pop songs here, you can choose your favorite artist don't think download it ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ¤©",POSITIVE
"In general I like the app, but if it let's you create your own play lists then it should allow you play it in the order you arranged not shuffled. Lower rating after I noticed that the majority of time I'm getting ads after every song.",NEGATIVE
Spotify speeches are better than other sites That's why I like it,POSITIVE
"Good selection of music, but the app is basically unusable without premium. Without premium, you can only play full albums and playlists, you can't fast forward or rewind songs, you can only skip five songs in per hour, and you can't go back songs on playlists or albums. The worst part is that all of these premium features are free when using Spotify on PC and Mac.",NEGATIVE
Like the app but it won't let me play songs if I'm at the gym unless it's connected to a WiFi modem,NEGATIVE
"In the last update, I'm being with issues, in offline mode, if I'm without internet, the app doesn't let me see the download list, and if I'm already on the list doesn't let me play the music, but I'm still liking the app... But a little disappointed ðŸ˜”",NEGATIVE
Love listening to Charlie Musselwhite and other harmonica players.,POSITIVE
Love being able to listen to the songs I love!,POSITIVE
Not just music. Unbelievable podcast selection.,NEGATIVE
"I accidently unlike a song from my liked playlist more times than i care to admit and it seems like such a trivial thing since you can just like it back right? Well yes you can but not the way i thought, it does come back but as a new song so that means straight to the top and after a while it got irritating because i got used to their old placement. My only note would be to fix this or add a feature that lets me put it back exactly where it was, it can even ask where it should go. I dont mind",NEGATIVE
It is the best music app I used,POSITIVE
"New update sucks, I listen to mostly podcasts and it pauses randomly and does not display the rewind, fastforward,, and pause option anywhere I've seen. When I put my earbuds away it use to stop the audio but now it just starts play from my phone.",NEGATIVE
"There's such variety and available music that you can enjoy tremendous amounts of diversity, I love that. Old and new artists, it's wonderful. Music to relax, music to work out with, music to inspire, music to motivate! Spotify is fantastic! I like that I can share with my Husband too. I also like that wherever I utilize Spotify my playlists remain as I make them, cool...really happy with Spotify!",POSITIVE
Love how every artist I listen to is on it,POSITIVE
I love Spotify been a customer for years premium is worth it.,POSITIVE
I've been on Spotify for 5 years. I've always loved it but now I play music for an hour and it stops playing. I either have to wait a half an hour for it to kick back in or it just doesn't kick back in and I have to change what I'm listening to. What is the problem please let me know! It's exasperating!,NEGATIVE
Great music selection and so easy to use,POSITIVE
"Try to listen to amalee latest album. Rise of the monarch, but everytime I try and I get a play list of random songs. Some amalee but most form random different artists. After 15 attempts I still only heard 3 of 10 song out of the album.",NEGATIVE
Constantly opens the media controls in quick setting whenever I connect any BT device. This shouldn't even autostart let alone start playing,NEGATIVE
"App is not great. Service is great. Hoping the app developers start to help the user more..or will return to Apple, much better App. Details: App crashes a lot. I have premium, but when offline App won't open my downloaded music. It seems the latest update removed the pause, forward, back buttons. Overall App would get 1 star, but the overall service is worth 3.",POSITIVE
Soo many irritating ads after every song it becomes soo damn irritating. Amazon music is much better !,NEGATIVE
Audio quality is top class. But sometimes it literally feels like I'm listening to ads in between songs!,NEGATIVE
"All the music I want, and more!, for a reasonable price.",NEGATIVE
Songs are not going in an order as I add it in favorites ðŸ˜¤. And the is happening. I not fixing it I will uninstall it for sure,NEGATIVE

"I download a couple of playlists for traveling, and I prefer to keep those on my SD card to free up internal storage. When I try to change the Storage location, Spotify crashes. I cannot open it, and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. This has happened a couple of times. Very frustrating.",NEGATIVE
Nice Ad app u got der.ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«,NEGATIVE
Keeps pausing my song and wont play it all the way through. I've updated the app and I've uninstalled and redownloaded the app and still have the issue. ðŸ˜ ,POSITIVE
Its so hard to just get one song on! And 6 skips per hour? No. This update has made it so hard to function anything! I would rate it lower if it was even possible!,NEGATIVE
Sucks when trying to play music in another device google asisten and play the same in my cellphone,NEGATIVE
"I tried out Spotify years ago when I got a free trial of premium from Pandora, and I have never used any other music app since. I absolutely love the ""Made for you"" section that curates songs based on what you listen to. I've found so many new songs and artists I absolutely love and I wouldn't have found them without Spotify. Just get the premium, it's 10000% worth it.",POSITIVE
Good app only downside really is the ads but I've come to accept it,POSITIVE
Best music experience without advertising,POSITIVE
Great app listen to music everyday on this app,POSITIVE
Best music app by far,POSITIVE

Good app ..good music..,POSITIVE
"Great music, better price. It's freeðŸ˜",NEGATIVE
"I feel very happy, Spotify playlist is ever before ever after",POSITIVE
"Unacceptable for a paid service that is this old to have this many bugs. The now playing bar, which controls everything, has been MIA for months. Music just randomly stops playing. The buttons to pause and play just randomly stop working. The only remediation is to force stop and clear the cache. Trying to get support from Spotify is an exercise in madness. Their forums are an absolute mess and their support teams understand the application less than a casual user.",NEGATIVE
"It's great I haven't tried any other music podcasts apps,",POSITIVE
I lesson to Spotify because it let's me pick the greatest song that it has or been looking for in years.i enjoy it very much thanks alot Spotify.,POSITIVE
"Brilliant, can control it 9n mobile while gaming on pc can even turn volume up and down and don't have to pause game",POSITIVE
Spotify is better but one problem I am facing is internet is on but app is showing you are off line because of this iam not hear song,NEGATIVE
I've had Spotify for years. Best platform for saved music and custom playlist. My fav part as a fan of sound quality. I set mine on extremely high quality for great sound especially if you play loud,POSITIVE
"Spotify started off excellent, but the problem I had with App has now spread to the desktop. I can no longer play a selected song, there is no longer that icon next to the song. Was considering the premium but this problem has caused me to change my mind. And yes I have restart computer and reinstall App. Happy for those who have no issue . Hope you guys could get this fix.",NEGATIVE
I love just having music that I like. I can find music even if I don't know the name of the song or the artist. I can choose my playlists according to my moods. I love that I can follow small artists as well.,POSITIVE
Use it on a daily basis and to be honest don't think after using it I could live without it ..music is my thing and what I use it for mostly obviously but gotta whack a few podcasts on now and again like true crime or dr.nosleep or the jack pod but best thing iv ever downloaded and won't ever have a phone without it again unless for some reason they stop the app ... Now for a 2 hour drive .. Alexa play Spotify :),POSITIVE
How can u play the song without cellular data,NEGATIVE

Great to listen to music.,POSITIVE
"Terrible app. UNLESS you have premium in which case, it is the best. 3 stars because even though I have premium I still remember how I suffered without it",NEGATIVE
It's good and I enjoyed to listen the music.,POSITIVE
"I made the switch from another service years ago and have not looked back, it was an easy transition , I find premium duo worth it so my kid and I can have our own accounts and play music at the same time",POSITIVE
I enjoy it. It is the best music app ever.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Fantastic app for listening to music and podcasts. My only complaint is that my downloaded podcasts don't show up offline. It may be because I don't have Premium, but the company SAYS I should be able to download and play them offline for free. Not that I'm ever offline. People who rate this app one star for the amount of ads are ridiculous. Yes, sometimes there is a 3:1 ad-song ratio, but ads are hardly ever longer than 30 seconds. Your songs are much longer than the ads you get",NEGATIVE
Very smooth...and recommendations are really making my playlist amazing everyday.,POSITIVE
Spotify it is a very good app *****,POSITIVE
Wonderful but offline music also requested,POSITIVE
I love it app so nice songs ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"It's not bad but not really good because it only has 6 skips an hour which is very low and you can only play song on shuffle. If I could play songs in any order I want,had more skips,it played song in my playlist not ones that aren't and it didn't have ads after 3 or 4 song,then the rating would be higher but until then it stays as a 2.",NEGATIVE
Excellent music allways and more.,POSITIVE
"Won't show the song that's playing, or let me fast forward/rewind",NEGATIVE
"It's very good but... I hate the fact that I can only shuffle! Like, I can't choose the song I can listen to anymore. (Unless that's a premium thing.) Also, the music downloads don't even work for offline!",NEGATIVE
When I go to search option it shows internet connection not available I restarted it but it was the same . Need improvements.,NEGATIVE
I'm paying for an app that keeps crashing every 5 minutes! Rubbish,NEGATIVE
I'm on 3 months of free premium so I can't complain. And my sound taste senses have been broadened.,POSITIVE
i can and will literally sit there for hours blasting my music through my headphones lol,NEGATIVE
Great music app it gives you all the best tracks!!ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½,POSITIVE
Nice very useful during travelling Music always helps us to rewind our memoriesðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"Awesome!! Thank you to the creators of Spotify!! I fu ki' love it!!! You guys have introduced me to the most wicked singles and subsequent albums. Truly, emphatically, I'm virtually certain I will never require another music platform. (Perhaps the integration of artist videos would be appreciated by many of your 'loyal subjects'). Again, Dear Spotify constitutents, THANK YOU!!!!!!!",POSITIVE
Just what the doctor ordered. Relaxing and soothing music.,POSITIVE
"Ive always been a Spotify user but right now I am pretty sick of how it always presumes I want to listen to a playlist on shuffle!! I can start playing from the top of my playlist but it will randomly then switch to shuffle after a few songs or even just completely change what I am listening or play 'songs I'll like based on...'. Tbh its incredibly frustrating and when I then try to play the next song I wanted to listen to, Spotify pretty much crashes and I have to reopen the app!!!",NEGATIVE
Simply the best music app have ever come across with good sound system and one thing is can do something else on the phone while playing music unlike other appsðŸ™„ which will stop playing. Awesome!,POSITIVE
"Ads are annoying but it's a great free service for music fans ,Can purchase ad free at a price",POSITIVE
App is not even launching on S22 after the latest update.,NEGATIVE
One of the weakest app I have used in my life after every song there is advertisement like come on the guy who invented this app and the way he is running the advertisement on it is a very stupid brain grow up its 2022,NEGATIVE
"My username pops up as my account code. My library is non existent, and nothing plays. After days of on and off trying to fix it, it still doesn't do what it used to do - what it's supposed to do. I shouldn't have had to put forth the effort for what is clearly a programming failure. I think that I can safely say that based on my experience, and many of the most recent reviews.",NEGATIVE
"The preview of songs is gone when I go to add more songs, it's a way that I can find songs that fits my preference",POSITIVE
"There is not a good scrobling app. At least with Spotify I get what I ask for. I used to like my music from the ""box chick"" but her developers broke the scrobling algorithm. That said, the ad free version is worth the money.",NEGATIVE
Great choices of music!!!,POSITIVE
Very bad I can't download songs even if I have premium plan,NEGATIVE
"It has no feature to stop it from taking over radio in your car. it is morning and your car is in Bluetooth mode. It starts playing music when you don't want anything to be playing. When you are listening to a news brief, and it ends. Spotify takes over, all want to to is think about what you just heard.",NEGATIVE
It's really good and all but songs sometimes get deleted and that's pretty annoying,NEGATIVE
"It's literally impossible to listen to the song you are searching for , very bad user experience.",NEGATIVE
Really bad phone app and even worse on PC/Windows. I stopped paying Spotify's ridiculously inflated premium prices and just use YT Music now...which also sucks but at least it isn't Spotify. Good riddance,NEGATIVE
Good but sometimes wheni use my shots xpro I can't hear the music..,NEGATIVE
"Absolute terrible update. When shuffle play is on i cannot go back to listening the song i played. And i can't even turn off shuffle play because it requires premium. Such a bad app i used past over the months. And when i go to a playlist, i cannot even play the songs. Worst update.",NEGATIVE
I can't play a specific song that I want. A different song starts everytime.,NEGATIVE
To to to totototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototo much of ads,NEGATIVE
My app updated and now every album Auto shuffles and I hate it. Give the option to turn off shuffle,NEGATIVE
I Love the App I rate it 4 Stars Because the songs Stop when I Watch A Video,POSITIVE
Good app but quite laggy when moving the audio time.,NEGATIVE
"The easiest music player I have ever used....original and cleaned music and songs are there...You can create playlist as your preference and list manually....especially in laptop web version and for tablets, it's fully free but cannot download music....there are ads available but which is not much annoying...So, newcomers why are you still waiting here...just tap the install button & explore the unlimited music universe...",NEGATIVE
Great spotify music,POSITIVE

You are good but to pay for music it's not easy to use,NEGATIVE
"Better than any streaming service available, quality wise, catalogue and interface. Lately it's been a let down though, it keeps pausing mid songs. Please fix, hence the four stars rating",NEGATIVE
Great music app. Everything was cool until last update. Now my playlists are being interrupted by recommended songs. When l contacted support they immediately responded and their looking into the problem. Edit: Problem solved.,NEGATIVE

One of the best application for music . Love it â™¥ï¸,POSITIVE

It is such a great app. It has all the songs a men can imagine. It also recommends good songs,POSITIVE
"When I signed up it said I was offline while I LITTERALLY had 5G, fix this please",NEGATIVE
"Lack of settings in webplayer for Chromebook is a bit of an issue. Also, updates often result in drop out of paired speakers & inability to play through blutooth (car, echo, etc) - when it works it's fine but can be very temperamental",NEGATIVE
i love it i can listen while i do other things in the tab definetly recommended it,POSITIVE
I like to be able to open app and my songs be there,POSITIVE

Best music with out interaction by any app,POSITIVE
The song quality is so amazing. I have been using this app 2 years. It has million songs to listen. Not a words to say about this. ðŸ˜Ž,POSITIVE
"- Stop getting rid of songs that are playable!!!! - I have downloaded songs and they keep saying 'unplayable' the next day - what's the point in all of this?? One of the ridiculous things of this app. - If a singer, band, or album is 'explicit' can you not just verify listeners that they are over 16 or 18 to listen???? Absolutely a joke ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ - Also, why does the app always crash ubexpectedly?",NEGATIVE
I personally use Spotify as my first choice music player and it's good but sometimes it doesn't show to album cover for albums that I have downloaded even with a working internet connection.,NEGATIVE

Cool selection of music. Not enjoyable if you don't subscribe.,NEGATIVE
A very good sound experience. Has all types of songs in it .Really smooth app. Controls are so good. Ads are a bit too much .Ads can be reduced. Finally a nice app for music,POSITIVE
"Looks like they deleted my review or something, I hate it when it's like play random song on my playlist and I can't skip it to forward or backward, that's 2. Fix it and I'll change my mind, I mean all of the user, change they're mind",NEGATIVE
Very annoying ads.. Ads are ok in between 2-3 songs.. But they put in between each song,NEGATIVE
Music is the only thinfs which console me when i feel upset so spotify helps me lot,NEGATIVE
"1ï¸âƒ£ sorting own playlists by recently added DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK 3ï¸âƒ£ Search by label (e.g. label:""cyclic""), album view displays endless duplicate results ðŸ¤¦ 4ï¸âƒ£ ERRORâ—in large playlists (eg DRONE / AMBIENT / DREAMPOP 590 hours), while casting to Sonos or Chromecast, when I click on any track, it doesn't play.",NEGATIVE
I always have Spotify music on while gardening.,POSITIVE
Bro where did the option to review the songs before adding them to you Playlist go. It's so stupid like why take it away. Not to mention the countless adds after every 2 songs,NEGATIVE
"I love this app, w premium is really enjoyable. The only thing I'm missing is a ""friends activity"" page, just as we have in computer devices, but in phones and tablets",POSITIVE
"Please do include ""Add to playlist"" shortcut as a button.ðŸ™‚",NEGATIVE
Good app but too much ads,NEGATIVE
Chill playlist is awesome,POSITIVE
The best music streaming app available.,POSITIVE
To be honest in comparison of other apps for song Spotify is best ever and forever ðŸ™‚ðŸŒ¼,POSITIVE
"This music is one out of a million of its kind. I love it, and I'm enjoying it.",POSITIVE
Listening to all my favorite songs/artists just makes me happier,POSITIVE
One of the best applications I enjoy listening to podcasts and favourite songs on,POSITIVE
Broken. Can't login anymore because it thinks you're offline for some reason.,NEGATIVE
"This is being critical. Spotify only cares about business work and profit, it was good until a year then lately nowadays am facing lot of disturbing circumstances through Spotify, it keeps playing songs out of my playlist even tho the automatic play button is off from the settings and I've seen ample of comments about the same problem being faced by people whosharing their experiences in Google and it is not getting resolved until I take their premium membership such things were not expected",NEGATIVE
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"Absolutely horrible, cant even choose a song to play. Works worse than ever before and honestly literally anything else is better, even audio jungle and you hear it screaming at you half the time but it's still better than back to back ads and to fix all of the horribly stupid problems that are only on mobile mind you, you have to buy premium. Genuinely scummy and has likely resulted to lots of people abandoning a once semi-decent app. Absolutely deplorable and saddening.",NEGATIVE
Very good app. But always log me out when I'm traveling abroad,POSITIVE
"Been using this app for many years now, cannot find many things wrong with it, it's extremely affordable for what you get and very easy to navigate and use as a whole. Highly recommended if you're looking for a consistent music app you're happy to pay for. (Just needs to suggest a wider range of recommended songs and shuffle a bit better in playlists)",POSITIVE
Doesn't work on wifi for some odd reason. That's when I need it the most. Probably gonna unsubscribe.,NEGATIVE
"Since I started using spotify, I've experienced a unique access to music anytime.",POSITIVE
"6 skips per hour without premium and the playlist functions don'teven work right, really? Talk about a cash grabbing company, the few ads were fine but now you want us to pay to skip through songs, that's ridiculous!",NEGATIVE
Has all the songs and bands I listen too...,POSITIVE
"The new update sucks, the only way I can listen to music is in a playlist, you can't pick what time you want the song to be anymore, you have to shuffle in order to actually listen to a song, more ads, and it fills up your playlist with useless songs, worst update ever!",NEGATIVE
"Liar liar pants on fire. ""watch this commercial for thirty minutes of uninterrupted music"" Fifteen minutes later the music is interrupted by commercial. Every time! Choose a song, press play and it plays some other song. Every time! Notifications blocked, still shows notifications.",NEGATIVE
"When i first started useing this app it was all amazing but after the add free trial for new users ended it became a little worse since the add but yk I understand so i didn't mine much, but not too long ago idk what Happened something ended that made it impossible to hear music u chose, cant skip that much anymore, can put the song in a specific time or go back to the previous 1, and before i used to slide the screen in the middle to see the other song and now u can do anything without premium",NEGATIVE
Spotify is broken I can't play the song u wanted,NEGATIVE
"Its the normal spotify, nothing too wrong its just that whenever i play my songs, they will just randomly stop. Lets say im playing a game whilst listening to spotify, sometimes it will just randomly stop playing, so then i have to go back into spotify to manually unpause it",NEGATIVE
Premium Version is the best!,POSITIVE
"All my favourite music can been played here,thanks!",POSITIVE
Hate where you can't no longer see the song count.. I like to know how many songs are in my playlist.... what a silly thing to no longer have!! PLEASE FIX!!!!!!,NEGATIVE
Grate and lots of diffrent songs,NEGATIVE
"It's quite annoying sometimes because you can only skip 6 songs at a time and I can't find the song that I want . I have made my own playlist which has like 12 songs, after 5 or 6 songs it changes my playlist. It's unfair only 6 skips an hour having to wait as well as that I can't play a song I want from my playlist but I have to shuffle play. But apart from that, the quality of the songs are good.",POSITIVE
"Music and play lists are great, but it doesn't respect the 30min ad free time for none premium members. It plays multiple ads back to back, however other then that it has been a good experience for me.",NEGATIVE
"1 star is too much for this app it should be 0 cause it's too restricting, it's very disapointing, i can't even play a song that i want. I don't like the update!!!",NEGATIVE
"Actually good, but getting ads more otherwise very good ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
I can literally listen to my fav music artist but I don't like because your automatic on shuffle which annoys me,NEGATIVE
"Love it! But on the new update, you guys have removed search songs from our playists and liked songs. I would recommend to change it. Coz it was so easy finding songs by the search on our playists. Please do that.",POSITIVE

OK app allows easy access to lots of music and podcasts ðŸ‘Œ .,POSITIVE
"Some issues with playing some songs here and there but overall, a great app. I've discovered so much good music to my taste in this app and I've been using it for almost 2 years now. It has helped me through so much bad times. The podcasts are also to my liking. I especially like ""Teenager Therapy"", they talk about feelings and things others are confused about. They simply explain it. Thank you so much Spotify.",POSITIVE
My experience with spotify so far has been very good ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Enjoying the daily mixes, sending so much unheard music my way",POSITIVE
Best music application ever,POSITIVE
Too much ads. Wrost app,NEGATIVE
"Wasn't sure I'd like Spotify, right away discovered a good selection. The Playlist are easy to make, in no time, had 3 made. One for work, one for chilling, an one for let's f-n Rock. My favorite",NEGATIVE
It was about to connect the music to the living rooms TV when I didn't even ask or idk how it got there.,NEGATIVE
"Unusable, with the constant crashes. I only came back because there's sometimes more music here then other services. It's still garbage, I really don't want to support it, since they don't care about their user base, they have questionable morals.",NEGATIVE
Super app in music,POSITIVE
Straight away it's telling me no internet...what is it with this App. Every other App is fine just for Spotify I suddenly don't have intetnet....what a load of RUBBISH reading all the NEGATIVE reviews says to me that they DON'T CARE SO GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT UNINSTALLED AGAIN. Staying 1 star plus I'm not going to pay for premium when IT DOESN'T WORK FFS FIX IT,NEGATIVE

Uninstalling it.. Has become the worst music app recently bcz of irritating ads keeps coming after 1 or 2 songs..sometimes the ads duration would be more than 2 minutes combined of 2 or 3 ads in between songs.. #Spotify,NEGATIVE
It helps a lot it doesnt give you adds that much and you can turn your screen off and listen to music at the same time unlike YouTube or any other rip off app spotify is the best app ever and I recommend itðŸ˜ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
the app on my phone doesn't work anymore after the recent update. it says my playlists are empty and i can't play any music or podcasts at all. it works fine on my laptop though. i pay premium and i can't use the app anymore.... coooooool fun i love it >:C fix it asap,NEGATIVE
I try to listen to a song but it puts a different one,POSITIVE
Worst app very slow loading ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend,POSITIVE
Premium is how you get everything you want like only Premium users get to choose a song from a playlist and skipping only 6 six songs a hour when you do Spotify you expect easy and smooth ride but nope only premium users have that make free accounts have either choose a song from a playlist or allow more skips,NEGATIVE
Please stop with the full screen Duo ads for premium. I'm not your target audience. Don't make me switch to YouTube Music :(,NEGATIVE
"So, unfortunately after their most recent update, it seems I and a few others can no longer use Spotify. I haven't been able to listen to Spotify for a good week and a half now. Every time I try to listen to my playlist, it'll just endlessly load. It's really a shame because Spotify has been my go to music app for a while now. I've tried all the recommendations to fix this, and nothing has worked. I downloaded YT Music and I'm remaking my playlist there. I may come back if the issue gets fixed.",NEGATIVE
Needs to have a night mode or incognito mode because my sleep music messes up my wrap at the end of the year.,NEGATIVE
"Any blue tooth device when commected will cause spotify to automatically open and play the most recent song you played last. No way to prevent the auto play. Needs to a addressed in the next update or you will loose subscribers. Upon doing research this is a known problem since 2015. Not sure why developers haven't fix this major issue. Only ""fix"" is to log out and log back in every time.",NEGATIVE
"This is best platform for listening music . But it is glitching in many devices , including mine too in which it was crashing as we play any song . Mine got fixed now but in many of the devices , this glitch is still there and hence i give 4 stars. Developers should look after this issue or else many of people will shift to other platforms like yt music , prime music , gaana etc",NEGATIVE
This is a very good app but there is so much ads of premium Spotify,NEGATIVE
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!",POSITIVE
1 star because developers refuse to fix the bluetooth autoplay feature. If the app is closed NOTHING should play... EVER! It doesn't matter If it is connected to Bluetooth or not. Amazon Music doesn't do this. Pandora doesn't do this. Only Spotify doest this. Why is that? Are your developers graduates of community college? Or maybe not graduates at all?,NEGATIVE
I have no words it's the best app every but sometimes it's will opt work but is super app,POSITIVE
I â¤ï¸ this app. I get to listen to different singer songs !,POSITIVE
It's great...just be nice if you had more skips and could play any particular songs on Playlist as you wanted without having the premium subscription.,POSITIVE
Great for discovering new artists and listening to the old ones that you know,POSITIVE
Worst applðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® I get ads after one song Please stop this app. It will be way better,NEGATIVE
"I love this app! I just start my tablet, start the app, select a playlist and enjoy great music for hours without having to do anything else. I don't know if there's any Greek music on here, as sometime is what I feel like listening to, but if I find some, I'll come back and add a sixth star in my comment. Edit: They do have Greek music, I found a long time ago, but I forgot I had made this commitment. They also have podcasts about anything, which I love!",POSITIVE
Suddenly I can no longer use Spotify properly on the phone idk how but they suddenly ruined a good thing.,NEGATIVE
Good app but i cant play the songs i want to it plays random songs i never even knew about in my playlist when i choose any song it plays random songs like that.,NEGATIVE
Love that I can make my own personal play list!!,POSITIVE
"It's kinda weird on when I was trying to listen to a long Playlist it was like ""YoU fOUnd A pReMeIUM FeatUre"" and didn't tell me what the freaking feature was. And when I clicked it again it just said it again with not even playing it. I'm going back to YouTube.",NEGATIVE
It's been awhile i have use this and i love this... But i gave it four star.... For some kind of issue âš ï¸,POSITIVE
I LOVE THIS APP YOU GET TO LISTEN WHATEVER YOU WANT so that why I give 5 star,POSITIVE
My entire library just got wiped and i can't actually play anything right now. Upset :(,NEGATIVE
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.,NEGATIVE
The best application to listen to music,POSITIVE
High quality music for all age groups and tastes.,POSITIVE
Its the best app for listening songs I really like the different album for different moods and from different countries,POSITIVE
If you listen to music this app for you lol,NEGATIVE
"I updated the app and there is SO many ads, like 2-7 ads after every 1-3 songs, and the 30 minute free ads do NOT give a full 30 minutes, I've started to use YouTube because it surprisingly gives LESS ads then Spotify now?? I mean I can't use it in the background on my phone, but on my computer I can, so I use YouTube when I can. Also the feature where you can listen to samples of the songs when adding them to playlists is gone, WHY???",NEGATIVE
"Great music, can send stream to Echos, computer, TV, phone, etc",NEGATIVE
I love this app I listen to all my music on it but it's so annoying when the app keeps putting songs on my playlist,NEGATIVE
Fun but hella ads,NEGATIVE
Best app but.. Wish I could dowload the music and hear it offline.. But alas everyone greedy :) thee non a problem,NEGATIVE
This app is trash it gets paused in the middle and some music advertisement comes and doesnt stop and you cannot even play the song you want to play,NEGATIVE
I only listen to my favorite murder for entertainment and white noise for sleeping. They are both ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
Almost everything is now a premium feature you can hardly do anything but I still like listening to music with the app,POSITIVE
It sometimes lags my phone severely. Sometimes it just straight up refuses to play the next song in my playlist until I open my phone and tell it to keep going.,NEGATIVE
"1 star because you can not just drop advertisement after every single song ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ are we streaming song or Spotify making us watch advertisement... According to me, Spotify should pay us for watching these advertisement ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",NEGATIVE
I have enjoyed using spotify.it is fun creating liked play lists.,POSITIVE
"It's a very nice music app, really I enjoyedðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
Great app love it I can listen to songs with my phone off but Spotify adds songs to my playlist which is so annoying,NEGATIVE
"Day 1 Pandora user that made the switch late 2021 because of the presence, artist count, album count, etc. 2 stars is generous IMO due to the not-so-seamless integration from GalaxyWatch4 and ZFold3 hardware. Additionally, what makes me really want to drop this to 1-star is the same YouTube TV ad playing 4 times consecutively. Sure I could become a premium user, but I use Spotify for 4 hours a month at best. I won't be moving back to Pandora simply because I'm satisfied ""enough"". Is that enough?",POSITIVE
Love this music app !,POSITIVE
This app sucks it won't turn off shuffle,POSITIVE
"This is good, but can we get a ""friends activity"" in mobile version, please, make it realtime.",POSITIVE
"the app itself is kinda buggy sometimes, but good quality overall",POSITIVE
I'm not using Spotify anymore cause they removed all the lyrics,NEGATIVE
Making your free version crappier isn't going to encourage me to give you money. It's going to encourage me to delete your worthless app.,NEGATIVE
This app SUCKS. When I try to play my music it never does it worse music app,NEGATIVE
Horrible. App has been broken the whole month. I want my money back for this month. Totally unusable. Edit: still garbage. Haven't changed any settings and it just keeps pausing out of nowhere.,NEGATIVE
Great Music App.,POSITIVE
"Freezing constantly and loads the wrong song selected (but never plays it) what are you, hourly?",NEGATIVE
"Fantastic. Premium is worth the money, for sure.",POSITIVE
Lots of advertisements coming past few week. Very disappointing,NEGATIVE
Nice but too many ads...,NEGATIVE
I am listening all day long as I do my yard work and great fishing buddy. I'm never board,POSITIVE
Best on demand music app,POSITIVE
"This app is absolutely amazing with the premium service. My only real complaint is that in the liked songs Playlist you can only select one genre to listen to at a time, it would be great to be able to isolate multiple genres to listen to in you liked songs.",POSITIVE
"i cant play songs seprate anymore. it comes up as a playlist, and that's extreamly annoying. you cannot skip more then 6 songs per hour without premium. the only thing i really like about this app is you can play things with the screen off and stuff.",NEGATIVE
"I am a happy user of spotify. Less ads even when I am using the free account. Plus, I get to stream songs from BTS members. I also love playlists and podcasts and the additional short vid playback for some of the songs. The app is easy to use and very practical too â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸",POSITIVE
"I'll give this a 2 stars for now, I agree with the low rated reviews. I LOVE listening music on Spotify but the problem is it's too restricted! It literally wants u to buy premium,I tried everything but nothing work! I wanted to listen 1 song ONLY but it keeps recommending me other songs that I don't wanna listen to. And I also hate that you can only skip 6 times for an hour!? Fix this problem and hoping there some improvements:/ Y'all really want mobile user's to pay money for some useless prem",NEGATIVE
All good but adds are more,POSITIVE
The worst music app. You can't listen to what you want without so many annoying ads that are not even in the language you have your phone configured. Soundcloud is a billion times better,NEGATIVE
"Good app, but it's been quite annoying lately sometimes when I'm playing a game while listening to any music it randomly stops and I have to go back in to fix it, Why does it even do that? It's annoying..",NEGATIVE
"This is literally the most useless app ever It doesnt let me listen to my music, i can't even listen to anything i want and the ads just straight up lie to you. If i could rate negative stars, i would",NEGATIVE
"You sit on a throne of lies. All those ""listen to this ad and get 30 minutes of ad free listening"" is bs. I get an ad either, between 1 or 2 songs",NEGATIVE
I can't even listen to the songs I love and only the songs I love anymore without a whole bunch of other songs come on instead it's so aggravating and you can't even skips as many songs as you want idc abt the ads but the other parts of this new Spotify app just ruined the whole app now I can't even listen to music that I want to pls go back a update.,NEGATIVE
Spotify plays almost everything I can remember and that's enough,POSITIVE
I do like spotify alot.. but i really dont like that i cant delete recently played list. i should have the freedom to do so if im paying for it..will be thinking of canceling account and payment.. Thanks,NEGATIVE
"I'm paying for this app and it's still so sucky??? Always glitching, can't see the music play bar on the app nor on my homescreen/lockscreen. No matter how many times i refresh it, update it and clear up my phone. Why am i even paying for an app that doesn't work efficiently.",NEGATIVE
First time downloading this app. Easy to use. Recommend highly.,POSITIVE
Easy to use. Great selection,POSITIVE
Great music and much more,POSITIVE
"Amazing, love it!",POSITIVE
Great app very cool easy to use and has every song would use 100%,POSITIVE
"I just want to know how 3.5 gigs of cache builds up on an app in a few weeks, when I regularly clear each apps cache through my phones settings. Also start paying musicians more you Cnt",NEGATIVE
Ads are annoying.,NEGATIVE
Enjoy listening to this daily. Now I need to store fewer mp3 tracks on my pc and phone. Love how versatile it is,POSITIVE
"It keeps playing misuc I didn't add on my playlist and won't play anything that's actually in my playlist. I can't even choose what song I want to listen to, it's like someone asking what you want but gives you something completely different anyways",POSITIVE
Stop buying podcasts and making them Spotify-exclusive. The ecosystem is decentralized and independent for a reason.,NEGATIVE
Super music selection,POSITIVE
Not got an issue really got everything im looking for only down side would be the price for multiple accounts,NEGATIVE
Has almost every song I search and it's a very good app,POSITIVE
Lot's of advertisement.......... One song one advertisement ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥²,NEGATIVE
Loving being introduced to music I might not have heard otherwise.,POSITIVE
Haven't worked it ourt yet but sure is OK.,POSITIVE
"I love the app, it's just now I can't choose the music I want to listen to on a playlist or my liked songs, it just chooses randomly, I had it in a specificus order I liked to listen to it, and now it just chooses random, and when I go to press on the so g I want, it won't let me and it just plays a little part and it won't play the entire song, and it is really annoying. I can still listen to music, but it just chooses and it's kinda annoying I just wanna listen to my music in order not random",NEGATIVE
The best music choices....there is no comparison.,POSITIVE
Been using this app for years now n premium has YET to fail me. Use this app daily and it never fails me. Thank you guys for such an awsome useful app,POSITIVE
"Even thought some there are some out there song I can get, such a great App to lookup any genre I need and listen all day to.",POSITIVE
I hate spotify with all my heart. I can't tell you how many times I have wasted an hour of my life trying to listen to one song and listen to ad after ad as I'm diverted to a song I didn't ask for. God please strike these lieing bastard down. My time is precious and I don't appreciate it being stolen.,NEGATIVE
"This is a okay app,it is probably the same as YouTube music or anything else. It's still nice and shows you all of you're favorite songs",POSITIVE
It's good but I hate how you can't listen to one singular song and the only option is shuffle and they add to your Playlist and I hate that I only want to listen to the songs that I want and you can't do anything but listen this app is bs and you need premium to do everything,NEGATIVE
"If I want to unsubscribe from premium... Why do I have to open my account in web browser? App must have that functionality, that saves time and effort, improves customer experience in a few words...",NEGATIVE
Literally horrible I don't understand why I'm trying to listen to music and ur sitting here playing ad after ad just after one song. And it would be the same ad get a grip,NEGATIVE
"Way too many ads i literally once got 11 ads in a row. It's honestly ridiculous, if you dont get premium you have to sit through 2-4 ads after every 3 songs its annoying and makes the whole experience suck. I get really overestimated sometimes and I have to play music to calm down but the ads really make it so much worse, especially if the person speaking in the ad makes mouth noises. There should be a way to at least flag certain ads so you don't have to listen to them.",NEGATIVE
No longer works on my phone!!!!,NEGATIVE
It has been very nice using Spotify till I can afford a steady subscription,POSITIVE
What happened to this company used to be good I guess now it's owned facebook I just found out today that for me to watch Hulu on a big screen. I have to pay extra membership now so that is that so it's all good. I tried to call customer service for Spotify and they don't even have a phone number anymore. What's going on? Everything by owned by Facebook is like just you cannot contact them anymore. What's going? What's going on with this company?,NEGATIVE
Easy to use I love Spotify,POSITIVE
"my life ; in my journal, written / recorded into a notebook.. with visuals, Photograhy / Newspaper Articles / clips, etc. For the Soundtracks of This, my, i, LIFETIME i have, all the years, . Thanks to SPOTIFY The PIaylists Keeps: The Music Playing.!",POSITIVE
Not happy about ads but generally very happy ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Great music library with useful features. Phone app isn't as great for organizing playlists as its PC counterpart though.,NEGATIVE
The Android app has a lot of issues with the queue for me - deleting and rearranging things. It's very frustrating but also the developers have been very helpful and responsive (albeit so far unsuccessful) trying to solve this. I wish Spotify as a company did more to limit the spread of false information and paid artists more fairly. Overall it is still the best music streaming service I've tried.,POSITIVE
It doesn't allow me to add more diverse music. It only allow some music to be available. Not very much to download.,NEGATIVE
It good there also ksi music is good as well,POSITIVE
Awesome music app easy to use recommned it to everyone,POSITIVE
"Great product. The algorithms are pretty spot on, I suspect because there are smart people monitoring and revising them constantly based on continuous feedback data from users.",POSITIVE
"Will not stop, stopping while I'm trying to listen to music and playing a game with no sound on.",POSITIVE
"So far, so good! Listening to music that I like with no problems at all.",POSITIVE
"Player keeps disappearing! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ the only thing that works is force closing the app which is not acceptable. I pay for this, fix it or give me a discount or I'm canceling",NEGATIVE
Owh very nice to this apps because all your music is already her.,POSITIVE
I love the music personally my favorite music app,POSITIVE
Its like it knows me! Love it!!!,POSITIVE
Honestly if Joe Rogan wasn't on here i would have you tube music but i have to say I've gotten pretty spoiled on the user interface pretty easy 5 stars,NEGATIVE
"4 stars for now, 5th one will be there when I can find the option to play songs from device which aren't available on Spotify. Otherwise, a good overall experience",POSITIVE
"With this app, I can listen to music without interruption",POSITIVE
My recently listened to section had disappeared and plus half of my homepage is ads for podcasts that I couldn't care less about even though I've never listened to a podcast on Spotify before. This app keeps getting worse with each new update.,NEGATIVE
"Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue but when I go to another app it will stop playing music, even though I pay for premium. Or it won't show what's being played when I'm in the app. Please fix this it's been doing this since the update and it's really annoying I'm considering changing services. IM GETTING SO TIRED OF HAVING TO CLICK PLAY BECAUSE IT KEEPS PAUSING ITS SELF WHEN YALL GONNA FIX THIS",NEGATIVE
"I re-downloaded the app because I liked it better than any other music app, but every Playlist is empty and none of the podcasts work. I have premium and I checked, all of the other apps on my phone work and I have a strong data connection so I don't understand what is wrong. I'd really hate to delete my account again.",NEGATIVE
Music is awesome!! Joe Rogan podcast is the only reason I downloaded this app because you sponsor him and he is my dad,NEGATIVE
"You don't need any other music app , this app does it all",POSITIVE
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was.",NEGATIVE
good app but the ads are to long,NEGATIVE
Love the music! Just getting started in Spotify.,POSITIVE
Recently updated version forcing me to remove this file from my phone. Thanks Spotify Bye Bye,NEGATIVE
Good but many ads,POSITIVE
You guys need to fix this app. The version that goes on the phone works fine but the version that goes on my TV SUCKS I've never been able to watch a whole episode of anything on it you have to log out and go back to the TV main menu and go back into the app at least once every 45 minutes.,NEGATIVE
For some reason I can't listen to the music that I downloaded for some reason,NEGATIVE
"I HATE the new update I can't listen to the music I want in my playlist I like the song but I just don't feel like listening to it right now, and then I skip and skip so I can get to the song I want the new update is annoying and absolutely useless I hope they fix this.",NEGATIVE
I was listening to one musician and the app started playing other music and I couldn't change it or pass. Not impressed.,NEGATIVE
"Had to go back to Spotify Free because Premium was a luxury I can't afford. Being poor is punishment enough without being taunted by awful features of this app. One album I love I haven't heard in entirety for weeks, as if some songs just aren't available. It shuffles in other artists, and plays songs already set to hidden, then the playlist stops before actual completion and I'm expected to start over with songs I've already listened to? Borderline fascism. Spotify are bullies.",NEGATIVE
A great music service.,POSITIVE
"-Sometimes when I switch device phone, computer or TV when I change song I can't played it and it jump to another song or app just freeze then crash. Sometimes for no reason I just got disconnected anf need to log in when I do I have message no Internet connexion so can't log in I have to clean cache for the app, uninstall and install it and log in again. Sometimes all my playlist are gone temporarily and all download playlist offline were gone so I have to downloades it again.",NEGATIVE
It was working fine but now nothing is working I can't play anything,NEGATIVE
I can't download over wifi unless I select to allow download over data.,NEGATIVE
Have been more than a satisfied customer now for over 8 years. Thanks Spotify,POSITIVE
"I use to like spotify until this new update, whatever this new update is it stoped me from picking the song i wanted to listen to because spitify ruined my playlist. It now shows a preview of the song i want to listen to and they removed the queue for songs. The only way i can use my playlist now is if i connect to my console or tv.",NEGATIVE
It's amazing I like the music and the videos,POSITIVE
Tbh this app is insanely overated because whenever I try to play something it plays something else completely different and I cannot change it and without the premium subscription you can only skip 6 musics per hour ðŸ˜,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming out there,POSITIVE

Best music app out here. Thank you spotify for making my life better.,POSITIVE

I used to love this app for finding music for my videos or just to listen to for free but now when I click on a song it plays a whole different song and plays LITERALLY ALL SONGS for half the song then goes to the next song :/ I hate this app I can probably find a better app for music and music for my videos I'm never installing this app again and I DONT suggest this app,NEGATIVE
"Harder to use each update. uses a ton of data, but wont work correctly in offline mode. Good luck listening to podcasts. Not user friendly any more, used to be great. Randomly shuffles. Have had premium for about 6 years now, starting to rethink, not worth 9.99 a month. If you only listen to music on shuffle on WIFI, this is the app for you.",NEGATIVE
Best music app around.,POSITIVE
Stops after about 30 seconds everytime I want to play somthing in the background,NEGATIVE
Sending ads every few seconds,NEGATIVE
"App breaks constantly, crashes, will be ""playing"" and no sound, or press play and nothing happens. Repeatedly having to close and restart the app to get some funtionality out of it. Hot trash",NEGATIVE
The best of all the music streaming apps,POSITIVE
Love this app! Better than audiomack,POSITIVE

Best music platform,POSITIVE
Always on time! Very consistent product!,POSITIVE
The Most Beautiful Experience As Far As Music Is Concerned! Loving Every Minute Of My SPOTIFY-ing!,POSITIVE
"New review- I would give less than one star because it was already on 1. The update I made today is now not allowing the app to play songs in a consecutive order if there is no shuffle on. Also when I want to play a song it instead plays something entirely different that's not even in my playlist! The app keeps stopping, it just pauses the sound and I can't make it start again unless I force close the app and open it again. Rubbish",NEGATIVE
Very good aap whichever I hope to play my favorite song this aap fulfill my desire Thank you very much spotify,POSITIVE
This is a great app for streaming music but sadly I don't have premium yet,NEGATIVE
"Easy to use, song quality excellent",POSITIVE
Nice can play my fav songs,POSITIVE
Samsung S21 Ultra. South Africa. Shuffle keeps turning on.,NEGATIVE
It was great until I had to play an entire Playlist to play ONE SONG!,POSITIVE
"Disappointing. I turned offline mode on as usual when I purchase a premium, at first it allows me to play my downloaded songs but now I can't even play any song and the offline button is gone. I can't turned it back off, better fix this problems or you will lose all of your users.",NEGATIVE

best app for listening songs,POSITIVE
"Glitchy and unacceptable. My Spotify has always been glitchy, closes at random, skips multiple songs, switched out of the playlist to a random one however now it's beyond bad. The play bar disappears constantly for days on end. This means I can't skip, pause add songs to playlist, pause podcasts, ect. I think this is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app. Yes I've force stopped the app, deleted and re download it.",NEGATIVE
Easy to navigate,POSITIVE
App is generally good but occasionally slow and buggy. I also have troubles occasionally with controlling songs playing and playlists when casting to an external device.,NEGATIVE
Ads are annoying,NEGATIVE
Too many ads on podcasts with Spotify premium.,NEGATIVE
I Love This App Because I find All Songs.. I wish you continued successðŸ’,POSITIVE
"It's OK. Has a lot of underground bands I like. App crashes frequently, often will hang on loading my downloads page before erroring out saying there's no internet (I download podcasts/music BECAUSE I don't want to use data) Also likes to change songs from what I was listening to to a completely different song when I get into my car",NEGATIVE
"I'm using this aap last one year and I have good experience with this aap. I used to like that the ads were not much, an ad used to come in 20 30 minutes. That's why, I used to recommend my friends to download this application. But for a few months, ads come twice every 10 15 minutes. Now I don't like it. I think that the ads should be reduced a bit, it is necessary to take some attention to spotify.",NEGATIVE
"When ever you are serious and wanna listen sad song then the add comes, 1 song = 4 adds.",POSITIVE
Let me listen to my own damn songs not some suggested songs.,NEGATIVE
Better than other music apps I have tried,POSITIVE
Terrible app that magically works if you pay for premium.,POSITIVE
"Spotify is nice and I have my favorite playlists on there. However, the ads can get unbearable and I used to be able to pick my songs without premium. And now I can't anymore, please Spotify don't make that just a premium thing. I can deal with ads but I hate having to listen to a song because I only have 6 skips. I like being able to pick the songs I'm in the mood for.",NEGATIVE
"It used to be amazing but now nothing ever loads whenever I click on my likes, artist, Playlist, etc. I thought it was my phone but its still happening.",NEGATIVE
"i love this app, but its not good without premium bc with premium you can skip unlimited songs but without you only can skip 6 per hour 5$ is not much if you wanna have no adds and unlimited skipsðŸ˜",NEGATIVE
Brilliant. All my music in 1 place all the time with me... what more do you want....,POSITIVE
Best app for songs....,POSITIVE
"Garbage. Spotify sucks at playing music. Several years paying for this app and it still has no idea what music I enjoy. If I ask my Google home to play a specific song off of spotify, it won't do it most of the time. Unacceptable for a paid service.",NEGATIVE
There so ad and makes me anger cause whenever my mood to listen song but whenever ad start play its very annoying after ad i really not want open Spotify plz we don't need any ads it's so annoying,NEGATIVE

"Best music app that i know of, but sometimes it gives me short clips thst are shorter than preview clips on my samsung(s). Or Prehaps, there is a setting that i overlooked.. Spotify is the fiurst music app that i've emgareed, Kind of easy to move around. Keep it up!!!",NEGATIVE
After every song there are two ads and you know that I am not listening to songs I am listening to ads what they say,NEGATIVE

Best Music App Ever..,POSITIVE
Best platform for Best old songs I like it.,POSITIVE
"It worked well all this time, but recently the just app crashes.",NEGATIVE
"Would be better if my freaking notification area wasn't always bugged. Seriously sick of it. That and I don't get half my podcasts showing a lot of the time until I reset the app 100 times, noticed it's the Daily Wire pods especially. Yep, and again today, was listening to a podcast that's mysteriously disappeared again of course it's a conservative one. Will be canceling if this keeps up",NEGATIVE
"The control you have over your music is crazy, and for the low low price of free 99",NEGATIVE
I can't see lyrics of any of the song,NEGATIVE
I give it 4.5 stars It should let u rewind song and pick what u want to hear by choice . Not follow the order,NEGATIVE
"If you hear music while gaming,this is the best choice for you",POSITIVE
The fact that those in premium can't download music to their hard drive is a bit unfair. Also at this point spotify should have dolby capability,NEGATIVE
Songs and lyrics are available at all times. Listening to music by all songs available in shuffle mode.,POSITIVE
i opened a discover taylor swift thing and now it broke the app. i'm reinstalling but if it's broken you're gonna get a real angry phone call soon!,NEGATIVE
"Need to fix the stupid app, it's so annoying to have to listen to 3 ads then only get to listen to 2 songs before u get more ads",NEGATIVE
Wow can't even turn off the shuffle mode I just wanna listen to my favourite songs and I need to pay for it?,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy the product. So healthy and encouraging.,POSITIVE
Refusing to recognize play lists. Now using browser version until fixed ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
Love this app until I can't play the songs I want anymore it's on shuffle and it adds songs to my Playlist. I guess I'm back looking for an app I can listen to what I want when I want! I'm so Uninstalling this app I'm so disappointed!,NEGATIVE
It's a nice app with background play and it's easy to make playlists and all..but I'd recommend it that you add the clear history option back and make it so that you know which song is gonna play next. It's a good app overall,POSITIVE
"Probably the best music streaming app available at the moment. Interface is dated, though. This is where Apple Music triumphs Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Best collection of music!!!,POSITIVE
It's better to listen on spotify rather downloading song,NEGATIVE
Sorry to say but it gives too much adds.. the more good is the music and the more is the no. Of adds . Btw I love it!! Just fix the no. Of adds...!!!,POSITIVE

Really great way to enjoy music,POSITIVE
Great and enjoyable music.,POSITIVE
"Its astounding how everytime i load up this app, something is wrong with it. Just now I tried favoriting a new album to my library, it says it saved, but it's not there when i try to open it. I try playing any kind of music? It gives me an ad that says its 10 seconds long and then gets stuck on that ad for 2 minutes!! Of dead air!! This is why i dont ever want to try premium either.",NEGATIVE
Sucks. Plays 5 seconds on my android and stops.,NEGATIVE
"I have loved Spotify since I got it, the premium version is incredible and pretty cheep. Algorithm is pretty good most of the time, but when it isn't pretty good it is absolutely terrible, that's the only thing that brings this down! Great app for music lovers",NEGATIVE
"itself, the application is good for listening to music, but it does not play the song you requested, they play the artist but another one of their hits and the one you want to hear they don't play. you make your playlist and right away they add about 50 more songs because according to them it's your style and you're going to like it! ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸",POSITIVE
"Spotify has every song I have ever looked for, including Shazam songs from television shows I watch. The playlists they create for me have gotten me through the brightest and darkest days in my life for over a year. Music heals and Spotify has a song for everything. Thank you.",POSITIVE
I wanted to listen to ONE SONG. Just a SINGLE song. App won't let me. Every time I click on the song it plays literally anything else. Can't find the song out anywhere else yet or I'd go anywhere else to listen to it.,NEGATIVE
I try abd try to play my liked song but it let me like there giving me songs that i don't want to lisen to that are not eveb on my liked and i press the shuffel liked song so it can play at least one of my liked song but ut stikl dosn't play my liked and if i try cliking on the song it jest gives me a prevu i liked the old spotify betty this us jest not if overall it sucks,NEGATIVE

Great music app. Easy to use,POSITIVE
this app is getting worse. now it won't keep my liked songs downloaded so I have to go on data constantly to listen to my music at work. I've been paying for premium for years to not have to deal with things like this and it's so frustrating,NEGATIVE
Cannot get to stop playing in the background. Canceling and uninstalling,POSITIVE
It won't let me play my music only there stupid suggested songs that I don't ever like FIX THIS,NEGATIVE
"Glitchy as hell. I install this to listen to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast and Glitched like crazy, crashed on me and when I went back to the episode I was listening to it just started back from the beginning even though I was already halfway through. Uninstalled immediately after that, too bad.",NEGATIVE
"To quote an ad from Spotify itself, ""easy to use, highly colaborative, works on any device.."" Love ittt!!!!!",POSITIVE
"My Episodes Folder makes this app useless offline. Every podcast I download is added to My Episode Folder, it happens automatically and it's much harder to remove than how it's added and undownloading an episode doesn't remove it. When offline I to go to downloaded podcasts in my library, but that just brings me to the My Episodes Folder, which won't load because there are undownloaded episodes in it. I can not access my downloaded episodes offline, so why have the app and pay for premium?",NEGATIVE
"This is the worst app for podcasting, awful at downloading, awful at offline listening. Awful for podcasts. Always sucks at downloading, never stays where I left off. The offline mode sucks. Skipping through ads starts the episode back over. Wish Rogan never made a deal with you guys. Never have an issue with Google podcasts Update 2022, still the worst podcast app I have to use. Wouldn't use it if it wasn't for Rogan",NEGATIVE
They have EVERY thing and I mean EVERY thing! LITERALLY EVERY thing! And I'm still discovering and re-discovering EVERY thing!!!!ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,POSITIVE
I get what I want when I want it. Outstanding!,POSITIVE
"I've used this app for 10 years. To say that I cannot live without Spotify is an understatement. It's so cheap as well to listen to unlimited music and podcasts. If you a willing to invest a small amount on a monthly basis, I guarentee you won't regret your experience with Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Nice but spotify can you keep edit the playlist option. If you need to add song by our own sequence. Please it is an request to spotify. Otherwise this app is very nice and I like the ready-made playlist.,POSITIVE
I love to be give 4 coz Spotify is using simple but when advertising Start I hate the app most,NEGATIVE
"The only thing I don't like is there is no way to replay as song you like, you can skip songs but you cannot go back to one of you want to share it or get three title and artist. Everything else here is work it, even on the free aspect.",NEGATIVE
Offline mode doesn't work and when my phone turns off and back on I can't go on spotify at all and I have to delete ALL of my downloads every god damn time even though this is premium... Jesus just fix your app.,NEGATIVE
why nowadays i'm not able to search song..When i click one song automatically another song gets play.,NEGATIVE
Great music with no ads,POSITIVE
Spotify is a amazing app for music and podcasts and I really like how it has all songs like pop rock all sorts of music.,POSITIVE
Worst worst app i hate this app a lot of ads making me irritating and not at all giving pleasant music with this stupid ads and subscription is highly cost and i feel so bad about it ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Good but there should be less ads but good,POSITIVE
Just enjoy the music and appreciate the free plays,POSITIVE
"Simple to use, happy I added this happy!",POSITIVE
"Overall it is a great app for podcasts with copious amounts of content but problematic on my Chromebook. I have problems several times a day where it stops showing me what is playing in the left side panel, preventing me from interacting with the podcast in any way. The only way I can fix it is to go into settings and completely delete the app's storage then log back in. This of course wipes out anything I have downloaded. Unfortunate but prevents me from using the app as much as I would like.",NEGATIVE
"Awesome I like this music app I really enjoy music in very high quality but some movies missing like rakshak, itihaas, mrityudaata, tere mere sapne, diljale etc",NEGATIVE
"The reason a fee paying customer does not recieve ""lyrics"" when they're actually paying good money for the favility, is because hhe failt is at Spotify. Customer's shouldn't need to uninstall and reinstall and fanny around with their phones and trying all other manner of fixes. The fault is at Spotify not on thousands of people's phones like the stupid fixes posted on YouTube and a thousand other places suggest.",NEGATIVE
"Had a 160 hour playlist before I got a free trial of premium, wasn't able to afford to pay for premium, so my playlist got cut down to 32 hours and I'm not a happy camper.",NEGATIVE
The enhanced feature on playlists singlehandedly makes spotify the hands-down only music app choice,NEGATIVE
Amazing the best song app ever,POSITIVE
It is a very great app for listening music and you can create playlists select different artists that you like and listen to their playlists or you can search the song and listen to it,POSITIVE
Best Apps for songs lovers..,POSITIVE
Spotify is the best music app in the world,POSITIVE
Excellent for recommendations! Has exposed me to many different bands that I didn't even know existed :),POSITIVE
I love listening to Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias but the only have it in Spanish no matter what you select. It sucks.,NEGATIVE
"I love your music platform, It brings an amazing experience and excitement to life. Thank you sincerely Mr.Wilson",POSITIVE
everytime I restart my phone the cover of my playlist change and it always crashes.,NEGATIVE
Updated: had to update to one star after I get an ad after every song! Old review: The app works greatbut no way to skip the ads especially when they are all unrelated and untargeted. Why the hell would I care about mental health and all that jazz for snowflakes? They just spam you to death with unrelated stuff. I never got one targeted ad in my years of use...,NEGATIVE
"The last couple of months it has been very glitchy. Every single time I open the app, it says it has updated exactly 49 songs and the app will then stop and cannot download this mysterious last, 50th song. I have to restart my phone. Absolutely painful. Also music playing but no currently playing displaying on the screen, have to go into the app each time. Randomly shuts itself down too. The share function hasn't been working either. Unacceptable for premium subscription. Sort yourselves out",NEGATIVE
"Very nice app , but too much ads",NEGATIVE
I'm from Louisiana and Spotify has everything I love all Louisiana hip hop,POSITIVE
Easy and versatile,POSITIVE
"Very bad developer's , after opening app network error is common ðŸ˜‘",NEGATIVE
"I love this app I can hear to bts songsðŸŽ§ðŸŽµ, hurray! And this is jst awesome for all, but especially for armys ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ¥°â¤",POSITIVE
Terrible if you commute on an underground subway. The UI and your library of downloaded and locally stored music cannot be played unless you manually switch the app into offline mode. The app should gracefully handle periodic outage of wifi/wireless connectivity and still function. Will likely be cancelling my subscription for this reason as Spotify is how I listen to music on my commute.,NEGATIVE
"I love the app and its function works smoothly for which they deserve 5 stars but I can't access Spotify podcast in Pakistan, therfore, I am giving 3 stars.",POSITIVE
Too many advertisements,NEGATIVE
"I'm especially thrilled that I can run other applications simultaneously with Spotify on my phone. Minimise, listen to music and carry on with everything else!",POSITIVE
The only problem is that I can't download it or play music without data.But I love it â¤ï¸ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–,POSITIVE
"For music, it is the best app but for podcast google podcast is the best for me. You should learn from them.",POSITIVE
Experience is absolutely great best music app ever,POSITIVE
"In my liked songs it doesn't allow me to play a song I wish to so I have to play it on shuffle and to add to that it only allows me to skip 6 times in an hr, doesn't let me add songs to queue or even see what song is next. This is all after the newest update which is honesty horrible because I do not wish to pay premium for features that should be available for everyone. Honestly speaking majority of music apps don't have such a thing and it's disappointing on Spotifys side to even think of this",NEGATIVE
"Frequently pauses and plays again for no reason about every minute, until it finally stops playing. Just started happening in the last week. Makes listening very frustrating. Glitchiest app I have every used.",NEGATIVE
Excellent music app one of the best,POSITIVE
"GREAT I love this app, old and new music. I can access via my phone, car and TV. I live for music so it is great. I pay a reasonable monthy fee to remove ads. The only bug bear is I download music for the car, and they sometimes it says I need to re download for no apparent reason which means if I am out and about I can't do. Also great for playlists and suggesting similar liked music.",POSITIVE
"This app was all good. I enjoyed listening to my favourite music, but all of the sudden when i try play any song it takes me to a complete different song. I cant ever play the songs i enjoy listening to because of this. If there is any way of fixing this, please get it fixed because i miss listening to my favourite songs without going onto YouTube because spotify wont let me play my songs.",NEGATIVE
Love all my playlist that Spotify creates for me!,POSITIVE
Love app but hate lossing all my songs when i cant aford premium should just lock em or not let u get more not make u start over had 3000+ songs in library an alot of it was new people names idk so cant find alot. So pay or kinda sucks an make youtube easyer its free to have a library an never erased or this would be 5* app,NEGATIVE
"Changed my 1 star to 5. Not even going to explain why, but just use Spotify as best music streaming service available.",POSITIVE
"The app is old garbage. Offline mode deletes daily playlist, daily freezes, you can't share a song without the app breaking once. It's just bad. Spotify is outdated as an app an same goes for the desktop application. Edit: I got my like playlist with 1500 songs. Spotify plays 20 of these if I press random. Still broken.",NEGATIVE
"Why are Singles and ep's shown as albums under Your Library Also, it would be nice if we could see liked song in albums, like it is with playlists",POSITIVE
I don't have much to say Just that it's everything i wanted from the app,NEGATIVE
Best songs app ever. Except the ads....,POSITIVE
"Really awful experience. Keeps shuffling songs and forcing me to listen to random things. I search up one song and click on it, and it plays other songs. I tried going back in the playlist, and that's not possible for some reason. This app is surprisingly bad.",NEGATIVE
"Just joined up, so far so good, just trying to work my way around it, atm",POSITIVE
"Most of the songs from any genre are available. Like it. And, easy to use.",POSITIVE
It works just fine but I don't like how there's no search on home screen ðŸ˜ ðŸ’—,NEGATIVE
Good selection but has a recent tendency to be glitchy.,NEGATIVE
"Everything I'm looking for and more, love it",POSITIVE
"I am not able to login to my account from my phone. I tried it more than 20 times. And now when i open it, it is showing only the logo.",NEGATIVE
"I LOVE THIS APP.BEST MUSIC APP EVER. IT'S ALMOST LIKE ALL ROUNDER , BUT I WISH I HAD AN OPTION TO DELETE HISTORY AND THAT TO SINGLE (I MEAN RECENTLY PLAYED PODCAST, SONGS, EPISODES ETC) CAN U PLS ADD THIS FEATURE.. ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜¥ AND ALSO THERE ARE MANY SONGS (ESPECIALLY BTS SONGS) THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE. SO PLS CLEAR THIS MATTER, CUZ I THINK MOST OF ARMYS INCLUDING ME WANT THOSE SONGS.. AND CAN U PLSS PUT KOREAN-ENGLISH AND KOREAN TRANSATION PLSSS",NEGATIVE
I was satisfied from Spotify in the starting but now I am just fed up of never ending ads for premium. In the starting there was only one ad and now they are just increasing,NEGATIVE
Breaking Points is the best show in Spotify.,POSITIVE
It's all I use to listen to music and podcasts,POSITIVE
Comprehensive content & professional delivery.,POSITIVE
They charged my card without my permission I didn't sign up for premium,NEGATIVE
Best app which helped me to upgrade my life quality. Helped me through lot of hard times!,POSITIVE
"I've had money in my acc for spotify for aver a week. Spotify never took it's money, and netflix did. So now i dont have money for this.",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify so much I have premium and it works so well keep up the new content,POSITIVE
"Just about every song you could want is here. Easy to use, and I really like that Spotify alerts me when my favorite artists have new music.",POSITIVE
The app is absolutely amazing and it's a 10/10 for me.,POSITIVE
If you don't have Spotify premium then the adsssss are like more than the songs in play list basically it's a paid app only.,NEGATIVE
"Edit: Since they brought back car mode I've raised my rating to 4 stars but there's still some weird bugs like being unable to access my playlists but music still plays and everything on the home page is fine. Old: So, let me get this straight, you removed the perfectly fine car mode - which despite the name actually had plenty of uses outside of a car - and replaced it with a mode that can only be used with the ""car thing"" - which is currently only available in the USA and costs a cool $80???",NEGATIVE
Thanks Spotify keep it up best app,POSITIVE
What the hack Spotify?! Why I can only invite family member to my account living on the same address!? Why the hell I would need so many devices on one address?! What a stupid decision to change the policy,NEGATIVE
This app is so bad don't download. If u play your favriout song it will start an anthoer song. Don't download,NEGATIVE
GIVE THE OPTION TO DISABLE THE VOLUME SYNC WITH SPOTIFY CONNECT FOR CHRIST SAKE!!! I have multiple Connect devices and I don't want them locked together at the same volume. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT IS AN EASY FIX FOR YOU!! Listen to your (paying) users because a quick Google search shows this is a common issue. 5 stars if this petty issue is fixed.,NEGATIVE
it takes too long to download an album and I'm using a good wifi please fix this then it's goan be a deff 5 star and can u make the download animation like that of apple at least.,NEGATIVE
"Great music, very clear. No b.s.",NEGATIVE
"Crashes constantly, very often plays the sound but doesn't show the player screen, so you can't pause or skip. Often while just listening the whole app just crashes. Integration with Alexa used to be great, now it's hopeless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't do what you want it to.",NEGATIVE
It is a very excellent app it has a option make your own album I like this option very much. it has all kind songs and lyrics. yeah it's a good thing excellent but sometimes it's logout itself please do something about it that's why I am rating it 4 star,POSITIVE
"Good streaming service, however the lack of lossless audio in 2022 is inexcusable",NEGATIVE
Absolutely crazy amazing. Spotify primume really makes the change.,POSITIVE
"So far, very impressed with the app.",POSITIVE
Nice app for song lovers I personally love this app,POSITIVE
Great sound great selection,POSITIVE
"Spotify tells that it gives 30 mins of ad free music but it gives ad after every 6-7 mins. And now it contains sexual content too. Idk what are sexual audios doing in a music ap. It's disturbing when such cheap content pops up on the screen while searching for my fav songs. Your ads are very irritating I swear. I know they are made to sound irritating, I swear the voices get to my nerves so much.",NEGATIVE
Its autoplay is off yet playing as autoplay.,NEGATIVE
"Usually great but recently the app has been bugging quite badly - I'll pause the music to do something outside of the app, and when I go back the control bar has vanished so I can't play, skip etc. Still have the bar in notifs but that stops syncing with what's playing so barely useful and even closing all, reopening the app & picking new song doesn't fix it, just now I don't even have notifs bar to control it. Really ruins the usability.",NEGATIVE
"Always love using Spotify, nice to get new playlists made for urself weekly to discover new music, can't live without music. â˜ºï¸ðŸŽµðŸŽ§",POSITIVE
This is very nice app In this app there is no add like other music add Please try it,POSITIVE
You dont have control over the songs you want to hear and that's supid,NEGATIVE
Marvelous Spotify is the best,POSITIVE

Not used to the interface yet.,NEGATIVE
Excellent this app for music is so good I love spotify,POSITIVE
"I hate the fact I can't put the song I want as a free user, I just want this one specific song to listen to first in my liked but I only get to hear a couple seconds of it, I have a bunch of liked songs so it's hard to get to the one I want in my liked. Also the 6 skips only and having to wait for more skips is annoying as a free user",NEGATIVE
I chose my music and found it good,POSITIVE
"This app is good after all but sometimes it doesn't play the song that I wanted to listen to, and also I hate the skip song limit (6 skips per hour) and I want it to be removed because it's annoying and frustrating. I'll rate 5 stars if you fix those issues.",NEGATIVE
In advertisement there is option for downloading song. But in that app it is missing,NEGATIVE
I love this app sm and use it every day. The only thing I'd say is I wish they had the same features on phones as on laptop such as making folders and seeing friend activity.,NEGATIVE

Best music streaming app,POSITIVE
I will never use premium. Show me adds as much you can.,NEGATIVE
This is dissapointing. Cant listen for 1 minute without a damn add,NEGATIVE
Good platform. I love it,POSITIVE

"I don't like the new update because I can't skip songs, I can't drag in timestamps and this app suddenly add songs that I didn't put in my playlist.",POSITIVE
"I get that you need to show ads to be profitable and grow your company but the amount of ads your app is showing me is just crazy, I counted the ads last time, I was playing a playlist and after playing minimum 1 to maximum 3 songs this app showed me a 30-50 seconds ad, in other words 5-6 ads in an hour. You do realise that you're just driving me away instead of persuading me to buy the premium? Please reconsider your ad amount.",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify. Do recommend for anyone who's thinking about downloading it.,POSITIVE
I bloody love this app. A bit buggy at times (especially offline) which cost it the full 5.,POSITIVE
"Offers all the artists & podcasts that I want, but every update makes it worse. It's been a year and this is still true.",POSITIVE
It's kinda slow sometimes but then again it might be my phone but so far it has been nothing but amazing,POSITIVE
"It does what it does, unfortunately not well but not like there's much better options. The app basically decides what you can't do and when. Want to actually listen to songs only from your playlist? Too bad! Here's a song that's not even in it! Want to repeat your music? OOPS! Gotta pay for that! Want to listen to a song on its own? Why would you! Here's a playlist that you have to skip through! Had the app for 4 months when out of the blue it started limiting what I can do. Annoying app.",NEGATIVE
Why my Spotify doesn't have a loop icon ! I'm so frustrated,NEGATIVE
Amazing App..Smooth interface.. great collection,POSITIVE
"Too many ads like seriously...now they are giving ads after every song..and they keep saying ""music ad free hi accha lgta hain"" dn don't give ads ... No matter how they try to change our minds with their ad style I am not gonna pay to listen music ... I would rather sleep...worst app ever",NEGATIVE
Love the way the music is displayed and organized,POSITIVE

I like the app works very when I want to listen to music during class,POSITIVE
Amazing App ! Easy to listen to music on Spotify.,POSITIVE
So many great albums and music being released all the time but I don't find it until months later because yall cannot put it into recent releases?? Why??? Why do you want me to listen to some trash dance music from drake but when a upcoming star like trapland pat releases yall can't even SHOW ME it. I'm boutta switch to YouTube music fr yall making me miss out on too much,NEGATIVE
My Spotify app doesn't work on wifi network. I don't know what's the problem but it need to be fixed. I even tried doing reinstallation but it didn't fix.,NEGATIVE
Best music app I ever used foreals ! Always finding the songs I want an more ! An the playlist they be making !! Sheesh slaps for days !ðŸ’¯ðŸ™ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ§,POSITIVE
Still trying to figure out how it all works. Sometimes. Music starts playing all by itself.,NEGATIVE
"I paid for a premium account but songs won't play. I press on the playlists but it just says its empty. Tried uninstalling and installing again, still the same issue. I don't know what to do",NEGATIVE
This app is where I listen to all my music,POSITIVE
Amazing if you have premium and if you can't afford you still have 3 months free,POSITIVE
Many ad and not connection to internet,NEGATIVE
Okay but adds are annoying.,NEGATIVE
My network is fine but it doesn't download and says no internet connection,NEGATIVE
This verry good music platform Thank you,POSITIVE

Best music streaming app in Play Store.,NEGATIVE

"The best music streaming platform, even though I don't have Premium, still, the quality is at its best!",POSITIVE
Its The Best Music App I Have Ever Seen,POSITIVE
Can't open after clearing catch data,NEGATIVE
Fun and relaxed way of listening to music and podcasts,POSITIVE
"I love it. Just the algorithm doesn't really work well for me. I get very weird recommendations like church songs, rocks that are not my type and podcasts that I'd never listen to, but not all the time. I got some very goodie goldie song recommendations too.",NEGATIVE
This app breaks if you try and put your music on sd card for offline use. It's been a problem for years and I see no hint of a solution.,NEGATIVE
Unable to login,NEGATIVE
"loving it can live with the ads so not subscring....yet! Ok subscribed, family plan. Very much worth it!",POSITIVE
The UI malfunctioning in dark mode.,NEGATIVE
Totally good no hangs or g glitches alot of options too,NEGATIVE
"Spotify itself, is such an amazing app! Even though, I was connected on the phone, I was still allowed to connect here, on my computer! This app is a defenite 100% five star! And it can even auto-pause your music when you are on a different app that includes game music, or something! But for the people that did not give Spotify a five star, you should now! Again, this is a great app! Thank you!!!!",POSITIVE
"Im here to rate Spotify not cuz It's good or anything like that. But to appreciate their amazing Marketing plan. The voice that says ""ever wonder how the other side lived"" is sooooooooo annoying that ppl would ""Switch back"" to premium just so they don't have to hear that voiceðŸ‘ðŸ½",POSITIVE
"can't choose song, can't skip song, too many ads",POSITIVE
So today bug is I have no play or pause or anything to stop music. I can select a song and it plays. But I can't pause it or anything. Lol,NEGATIVE
"Why do you need my card details for free premiumðŸ˜¡ Songs in liked list dissapears out of the blue.song search needs a lot of improvements. Anything good in this app Is its ads, very irritating, just like they wanted it.",NEGATIVE
"Edit: they patched spotify to encourage users to buy premium, otherwise free version is pandora clone. Premium is worth it tho.",POSITIVE
Not as easy to navigate and search as others,NEGATIVE
Honestly love this app gets me through my day and works well the adds aren't so consistent so it doesn't really bother but I would love to atleast have the control over changing my songs even if I'm not signed up for the premium version but still a pretty good app,POSITIVE
"Super annoying to use for both podcasts and music. When listening to a podcast, sometimes it will skip either way back or way forward, so you have to be on the app just to see if the podcast is on the right EP. Plus Ads are atrocious. Sometimes the 30 min uninterrupted won't work. And if it does work, when it's up you'll get about 4 ads in a row before you can listen to your playlist again. What happened to this app? If there was a better music app, I would've switched long ago.",NEGATIVE
"even though having premium is amazing, there's still a lot that spotify offers :) i love the personalized mixes",POSITIVE
Y'all are the best music app ever,POSITIVE
"This app is amizaing cuz you can listen to music anytime you want, and after the update it got starting to be restrocting cuz of the shuffle plays and i can't listen to music properly, please remove the shuffle play",NEGATIVE
Sweet sweet every song by my favorite artist just like that so cool,POSITIVE
Wonderful variety of music is excellent,POSITIVE
Favorite streaming music player!,POSITIVE
Liking the new 8 ads for every 20 secs of song. And the pop ups every time you try to get the lyrics. You massive trillion dollar corporations don't get the money you deserve.,NEGATIVE
"POOR App ,Every 20 min Ad roll Continues..clear the bugs",NEGATIVE
"Best app if you are sad or bored you can listen your favourite music, podcasts, Artist or playlists I like this application",NEGATIVE
I have internet connection and other apps is working good but in Spotify it shows no connection while searching.... What is this.?? Tactics to get more premium membership.... Very cheap and annoying Worst experience....,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is evil. It's owned by the music industry. This is their way of paying the artist they already barely pay even less. And don't forget, the crumbs that they pay the artist from Spotify is still 75% their. So when they ""pay"" an artist a dollar the artist gets .25 cents and they keep the rest. Spotify is the most disgusting thing these greedy record companies could come up with. They already rape their artist and take all the money they make in exchange for doing nothing at all.",NEGATIVE
I'm paying 9.99 every month still it is another month not getting what ads.last payment 16/1/22,NEGATIVE
I don't like how it can turn on by itself when I try to listen to video on my car and it will start running not a good thing needs to be delt with soon,NEGATIVE
I try to play a song that I always listen to and it plays something else not the song i want to listen to at all. I can go right to YouTube listen to it without no problems on YouTube at all.,POSITIVE
"Randomly stopping while playing and when I restart app or song, there are no controls on screen.",NEGATIVE
"I like the app, and I can find music relatively easily. The only issues I have are that if I add too little songs to a playlist, Spotify adds more, and there are so many ads. I can barely go 5 songs without getting 5x the ads. I understand that premium features are to earn money, but limiting skips and features that some people need but can't afford behind a price is not understandable to me.",NEGATIVE
The app is easy to use and produces good sound quality when subscribed to premium. The downside is you have a lot of missing songs ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸,POSITIVE
Literally only good paid or on a computer,NEGATIVE
Was good. Started getting glitchy over last couple of months until it stopped working. Despite reinstalling ap. will change to someting else.,NEGATIVE
I like this app and uses it practically everyday or whenever I need to listen to music only problems is that some of the ads to me are weird but other than that really good,POSITIVE
"You shouldnt have to buy premium to play an individual song, instead of it randomly generating a playlist and shuffling it into it for you to find.",NEGATIVE
Why you gotta play adds before the song even ends bruh,NEGATIVE
Random log out and when I log in again with the same email and password saying that my password is incorrect. Very enjoyable music player. So I gave you my 1 star :)),POSITIVE
"So I got asked to leave a review again, not changing it from 1 star because, while I use it everyday, I would jump apps in a heartbeat it someone made a better podcast app. I pay for spotify. Any justification for ads on podcasts when I pay FOR NO ADS is BS.",NEGATIVE
Crashes all the time and won't play downloaded music or Podcast half the time,NEGATIVE
"Great app for music but missing so many tracks from so many artists and gives preference to iOS devices for updates and features, appreciate if swipe to queue feature is rolled out soon enough, as the iOS users have been enjoying this feature since years.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely shite can't even listen to the song I want to super long ads just not as good as it is in consoles,NEGATIVE
Very good app better than Pandora,POSITIVE

Having a great time playing music that I haven't heard in years.,POSITIVE

I'm not very technical but I'm happy so far,POSITIVE
"So After 3 Years I Log Back On And, ITS FIXED. THANK U SPOTIFY I WUV U! Here Is what i said on october 26 2019 : the new update is TARABLE i hate it i can't play songs from playlists i say they shold bring back the old vison and everone thats with me commit down below",NEGATIVE
"The Android app continues to suffer from years-long issues. Failing to detect internet connection, randomly closing, weekly playlists not updating, playback stopping entirely or momentarily a couple of times a minute. On both a Samsung Note 9 and now still on my S22 Ultra. Constantly needing to clear all data and reinstall the app. The iOS version is much more reliable.",NEGATIVE
Best way to listen to our favorite ðŸŽ¶ music,POSITIVE
"I'd like to see all my top podcasts when I open the app; I only listen to about 5 constantly, but some of them disappeared from the home list. I pay for premium, but aside from no ads, is there any other benefit?",NEGATIVE
"Won't connect to kenwood, spotify has no fix for 2yrs",NEGATIVE
It is a good music app but it ain't you-tube,POSITIVE
It's was good for the first seven days but after that it sucks I tried to get premium but I couldn't cause I LIVE in quebec it's dumb also now when I play a song it plays a complete different one,NEGATIVE
"The app always plays songs that aren't on my playlist, I tried removing the songs from my playlist but I can't find them. They're not in the recommendation either, please fix this.",NEGATIVE
"I cannot see anything when I go to my library, all my playlists are gone. The app is unusable.",NEGATIVE
"Player sucks, service is ok.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is also part of Apple Inc and billboards are top charts,POSITIVE
It's really easy to use,POSITIVE
Love how easy it is to personalize,POSITIVE
Brilliant and easy,POSITIVE
I love this app bc it has any types of songs you can listen from here i recommoned to have this app! :D,POSITIVE
You should be able to cancel your subscription from the app.,NEGATIVE
"I search song, i get song, i play song, i never get to listen the selected song, shuffle forced, system forced, hate more than i need to :-(",NEGATIVE
"Very pleased with the ""free"" version of Spotify.",POSITIVE
"Says I can listen to music offline, sits and tries to load my Liked Songs for minutes on end before showing me the songs I already have downloaded",NEGATIVE
This is a pretty great app. There's just a couple problems I can't explain,POSITIVE
"When I first got the app, I really enjoyed it. No ads, could play whatever I wanted, etc. But just today they put in this awful update that makes it so you can only preview songs in a playlist, making it hard for you to pick and choose which song you want to play when playing the playlist at once. I'm suddenly getting ads and limited skips now, something that wasn't happening before. And this only happened within the last 2 weeks of getting the app. Sorry guys, not spending money on music.",NEGATIVE
When I pick a song it always plays a different song please fix this bug.,NEGATIVE
Great to listening to music,POSITIVE
"Premium user , my downloaded songs keep getting deleted from time to time and I Have to uninstall , reinstall , and then Re-download music all again. Why am i paying for a service that instead of making things easier , it's making it harder for me. Unacceptable",NEGATIVE
"Has been great, hate to say that too early though...",NEGATIVE
Awesome great music.,POSITIVE
"Why should I download offline and I won't be able to view the lyrics unless I switch to online mode. If I use Spotify, it's because of the lyrics Please work on this. The lyrics should be downloadable offline. Treat as URGENT until then it's a 3 star",NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause.",NEGATIVE
Its great but it glitches sometimes!,NEGATIVE
"It's good but I have a beef with Spotify in that I can't get certain songs on it, and sometimes a song I have will be taken away unannounced for some reason. Last thing, shuffle play isn't great. I have 600 plus songs. I shouldn't be having the same few songs show up for days in a row. It's good though. I can barely keep up with all the recommendation playlists.",NEGATIVE
"Somehow my favourite tracks are hidden in one of my playlists (which I never did) and I can't unhide them. I have switched on ""Show unplayable songs"" in my settings but the ""Hidden"" Button is still broken. Please fix this, I'm paying money for this app each month.",NEGATIVE
I love this app it has amazing songs and all the songs I love,POSITIVE
Great choice of music with wide range of genres.,POSITIVE
I called several times. No one seems to understand my problem. It playes ever other song in a different language. Not hard to understand. Bad system for my phone. I am done with them overall.,NEGATIVE
"This app is great but., sometime songs or storys that I'm listening to stop and then when I try to replay the it keeps say ""nothing is playing"" but you can still here it usually it's just needed and update but not all the time so Please fix this thank you.",NEGATIVE
"I love this music app, the music is amazing then the lyrics ect I think Spotify just has more options compared to other music apps like pandora",POSITIVE
"Its a great app! Has worked perfectly across multiple phones my sync system in my F350 operates it for hands free, it does take a little time to figure out the bells and whistles of it but once you do it works great! Oh and it works with my android tvs and I can control them from my phone with the app as far as music is concerned. Good job devs!",POSITIVE
"Repeatedly stops during a song. Updating, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work.",NEGATIVE
"I can't renew my Premium Plan, My payment details doesn't show up when i try to renew. i don't know if i'm the only person experiencing it. Help!",NEGATIVE
Needs to be just the song or Playlist that is chosen to be played by the listener and needs to have no premium and should be add free,NEGATIVE
Because I find all the songs that I'm looking for and I like,POSITIVE
What is up with all these updates there is literally an update every other day just make one big update and leave it alone for a bit. I feel that everytime I want to listen to music I need to update it first. Literally your last update was on June 19th and there was just another one today on June 23rd think of these updates all at once if you can cause all these constant ones are just annoying at this point. I love listening to music on this app but I feel I'm doing more updating than listening.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best application to listen musics and play podcasts.Ä°t is functional and pretty easy to use.I have never experineced any tecnical problems so far and I can almost find the every song that I wish to play!Sound quality is amazing and playlist accses is more refined compared to other apps.You can convinietnly connect it to various devices and play in different platforms.I would be so glad if Spotify crew made those facilities that I mentioned more reachable for free users too:-),POSITIVE
I really enjoy Spotify. Great improvement from what I was listening to.,POSITIVE
Why the hell Bluetooth headsets of all brands get disconnected while using this app. When will you ever rectify this? Irritating to the core,NEGATIVE
Maybe I will rate it 5star after I have maybe enjoyed the spotify,POSITIVE
Music is good nice selection of songs,POSITIVE
Worst app ever you cannot skip a song plus you cannot listen to a specific song. Don't download it. They're giving advertisements lije its a best app in the world. Disappointed!!!!,NEGATIVE
Excellent streaming service,POSITIVE
Bro it never did this and now after every single song it plays an ad tf is that about like what,NEGATIVE

Excellent app for everyone's musical choices,POSITIVE
App is amazing but we don't listen songs offline,POSITIVE
"Great when subscribed to Premium, but my favorite part of Spotify is the Dumb Blonde Podcast by Bunnie (Jelly Roll's amazing and beautiful wife).",POSITIVE
"This music company js absolutely disgusting. Not only can't you play the song you want if you don't have premium, but it also has ads. Absolutely horrible and definetly not worth it without premium.",NEGATIVE
Too many ads.,NEGATIVE
Not working properly,NEGATIVE
Since the update. Spotify has change layout on mine and not on other people I know. Also doesnt play the right songs that are in the album of playlist. As play artists and songs that are not in the playlist or album. Edit: Still the same set up and its shuffling albums and play music from artists that aint put in playlist. Also playing music from different artists even tho in a specific artist album.,NEGATIVE
Still a solid choice for music,POSITIVE
I like how you can select singers & groups ahead of time. Also the app puts together a daily mix based on your listening choices.,POSITIVE
The best app to listen to my favourite music nice.... HD sound nice experience. The app is also easy to use. But the only thing in this app is.. The ads. I can't even listen to next of my favourite song bcoz of the ads. I get a ad after every single song and the same as and the same type of ad like: don't like interruption while doing this or that so buy Spotify premium. What if I don't have money to spend on some apps or if my prents don't allow to use money on apps. Then what should I do?,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the bestðŸ˜Ž.Trust meðŸ˜ŒðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
I love Spotify because it lets me be me and not what it wants to make me to fit in. It offers me all that I want in music; there is nothing I have not found in search and their expanded program is awesome. Premium is wonderful and so inexpensive! I am sorry I waited so long to get it!,POSITIVE
Suddenly the song stops and starts after an hr. I mean wat is this. Is someone controlling our device???,NEGATIVE
I can't get threw a day of work or home for that matter without my Spotify best app I ever used,NEGATIVE
"The computer app is awesome, but the phone app feels oversimplified. It's missing information such as track length, number of songs in a playlist, number of streams on a song, and when a song was added to a playlist.",NEGATIVE
Need to vary the ads more.,NEGATIVE
Great app however I would like to have the option of deleting certain songs from the suggested playlist,NEGATIVE

Amazing! Works great.,POSITIVE
Always enjoyed this app. Every type of experience and type of music you need.,POSITIVE
This app sucks. If you do not have premium you can not even choose what song u want.,NEGATIVE
Too many ads after every 2 songs ad comes,NEGATIVE
"Very inconvenient, in comparison to the desktop version",NEGATIVE
"Nice music App really, Would have given 5 stars but I could not subscribe to a premium service. Even with a Mastercard Debit card. It's really frustrating. Fix it and get 5 stars",NEGATIVE
"Amazing, for a free app",POSITIVE
Amazing for listening to music,POSITIVE
Guys I don't need add free music stop giving this amount of add... It's toooo much annoying for me,NEGATIVE
Amazing Just amzing I love it and the premium Pack Is So good to use,POSITIVE
The algorithm knows my music tastes and gives good recommendations. I like the features that let you queue your playlist and edit as well. The collaboration and privacy features are good. I wish there was easier ways to set the sleep timer but the fact that it's there and has so many time options is fantastic. The radios are great and convenient. Overall recommend.,POSITIVE
"Sportify is really a wonderful app, I was actually shocked when it created a playlist for me and in the playlist was actually the kind of music I listen to and some were particularly the songs I love. Am giving it a 5 rating start because the application and the team deserve it, it's really a wonderful app. I will be glad if I could get a free month subscription thoðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
"I've found that if I ask for one song by a certain artist, it is followed by a nice playlist that Spotify has put together and I can just listen all day without getting bored!",POSITIVE
There's really a need for you to understand how annoying your ads are,NEGATIVE
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music.",NEGATIVE
"Paying for family membership, Spotify keeps stopping, plays randomly after leaving the car & often no function to stop rewind or forward. More often than not have to go into my apps to force stop. Very disappointing!!!",NEGATIVE
Didn't realise when I downloaded that it's a trial experience and after a couple of weeks they pretty much make it useless to use. No thanks. Back to Amazon Music for me,NEGATIVE
Love it and it doesn't recommend some music from India that I might be interested in like pandopa,POSITIVE
"I only put it to 4 stars because when I add it to favourites and play it the song is just short, and I hope you guys do an fix it cause I now only use it ones a month, and I love the app",NEGATIVE
Wonderful app easy to use,POSITIVE
"I love it. Huge songs collection of any style music. High quality files and amazing softwere detecting the sound you like and giving you good recommended music for your preferances. App organised really well, it is a pleasure to use it. So thankful that Spotify exists and evolves.",POSITIVE
Excellent app for all music needs.,POSITIVE
As convenient as the app is its got some glaring issues. First of all if you download songs it still streams them vs using the download files. I know this because when I try to play a band I've downloaded it always delays going to an album or song if internet gets in a patchy area. As soon as I put it on airplane mode it works fine. Unlike the YouTube app where you download and it'll always play the downloaded video. I feel like this app is 15 yrs behind what other apps have figured out in 09,NEGATIVE
Really?3 ads every time I start anything?,NEGATIVE
"Well, Spotify is great as always, but the Android app has a few rough edges around Chrome Cast: 1. Disconnecting wireless headphones while casting breaks the cast, the app switchws to on device playback through the phone's speakers 2. Connecting wireless headphones while casting makes the app switch to on-device playback, I don't know why",NEGATIVE
A chance to reverse songs on free tear,NEGATIVE
One of the best music streaming services out there. The premium membership is definently worth the price for no ads and higher music quality. Spotify also has a discover weekly playlist that based on your listening preferences will find new music for you. All in all Spotify is an amazing app give it a shot.,POSITIVE
best for update ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ and waste your net first and second play song i am listening the song but 1 min ma update i am open app crash ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,NEGATIVE
It is a really good app but the ads get on my nerves but i dont want to pay for a music app,NEGATIVE
Can't disable Auto start when Bluetooth connects? Seriously? Not an issue with any other media app. Cook the books on total user streams much?,NEGATIVE
"I love the app, it's great and i even love the ad's! Never too far off a commercial.",POSITIVE
2 stars becuase its a way to listen to music when playing xbox but the amount of ads you get ruins the whole thing. 4 songs and then 6 ads is what i tend to get most the time. Im looking for alternatives so i can listen to music on my xbox without being bombarded with ads,NEGATIVE
Is in awesome music app. I love it,POSITIVE
Whenever I pick a song it will always play a completely different song.. Think I'll stick with YouTube ðŸ–•,NEGATIVE
Very good app for music lovers where you can find songs and albums of your own choice...,POSITIVE
Love this!!! My 17 year old granddaughter got me hooked So many songs. Much better than Pandora.,POSITIVE

Very good app for listening to music.,POSITIVE

Very nice music platform,POSITIVE
"An amazing app for Listening music! Perfect quality and facilities! The only thing I didn't like bout this app is that we get a lot of advertisements which can ruin our mood for listening music ðŸŽ§. So, the thing that i'd request them to change is 'stop putting a lot of advertisements.",NEGATIVE
Use to be great. Had Spotify for a long time offline always worked well and stuff downloaded. Now it's super slow to pull up Playlist and sometimes doesnt work at all offline even though I pay. Not sure this app is worth paying for anymore.,NEGATIVE
Stupid adds after every single song now. Forget this useless app.,NEGATIVE
Had Spotify for over 7yrs now and worth every penny,POSITIVE
Stop adding songs to my play list. And stop controlling my skip button.,NEGATIVE
I like spotify but they really need to fix the app. It pauses mid song then I'm not able to pause stop go back or anything.,NEGATIVE

I cannot like the horror story but you can send me a horror story next time you can send me horror story so I am delete you your this app understand,NEGATIVE
All good except it doesn't contain some of the great music covers that you can find on YouTube and that the only reason for my 4 star rating.,NEGATIVE
"There are better music options with less ads, for less money, and even free. This service is overrated and just not worth it.",NEGATIVE
Feel it hard to interact with as without premium you are forced to listen to other songs than the one you want. Which is annoying.,NEGATIVE
Love listening music to this apps,POSITIVE
"Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AFFIRMED this fact in their landmark decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v.

Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AF",POSITIVE
In the last week Spotify keeps dropping In the middle of a song or in the middle of a Podcast and it does it repetitively about every 3-5 minutes. This needs to get fixed! I love spotify but I may have to change if it doesn't get addressed.,NEGATIVE
I can't say anything. Just awesome experience. I'm using it now with free benefits offered by you.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ But plans are Little bit higher.ðŸ˜”,POSITIVE
I like it it's just that you can't skip less that 6 song per hour and i had a free trial of premium and the set up was completely different and I got so used to it that's all 3 stars,POSITIVE
"So far so good... Love the home page,",POSITIVE
This app is good but since few days I m facing a problem of no internet connection on mobile data but my net is working very well .. I reinstalled but then also I face the same problem. My internet service provider is Airtel.,NEGATIVE
I have learnt so much I did not know by reading the write ups about the artists!,NEGATIVE
Advertisments are repetitive,NEGATIVE
Love everything about Spotify,POSITIVE
My Spotify Mobile app skips more than my old Walkman even when I have full signal. Friends send me links to songs for Spotify and it never opens up to the song they sent me so I just have to look it up myself. Want to create a blend with me? Too bad it won't let me follow the link to join it. Spotify Mobile is really garbage.,NEGATIVE
Frame drop is too much,NEGATIVE
I had some problems with it not playing the song I wanted but I found how to fix it just go on your phone then Spotify and do the same on your TV and play one song from your TV and you can play what you want from your phone after,NEGATIVE
My only problem random song shuffled.i want to listen to unstoppable sound and it randomly shuffle the song to happier.other tan that it's op,NEGATIVE
"I went into an area where my phone service didn't work and I've lost all of my music when the app closed out and booted me off of my account, which I can't get back into. The amount of ads being 4 to 5 every other song.",NEGATIVE
Good compilation of my type of music selection,POSITIVE
There is a lot of advertising,NEGATIVE
It's the best app of music I have ever used,POSITIVE
This app is unstable the automatically play song is on I really can turn it off I tried many ways it still doesn't turning off,NEGATIVE

Just love Spotify!.....,POSITIVE
I can't even loop my favorite song and others bro put it on premium for no reason bro ðŸ™„ sh*itty app,NEGATIVE
"A great app, all of the music you could ever want is here and for no cost at all, would recommend. Edit: But if you do want to pay, just use apple music instead, much better quality",NEGATIVE
Love it. I must say that i am impressed. I love the selections,POSITIVE
So on moblie android or any other handheld device you cant pick what songs to play and it shuffles them. But on computer or xbox it does let you pick songs and if you want to shuffle them,NEGATIVE
Pretty fast Can always find what I'm looking for. I really love this app,POSITIVE
"I use this app everyday. I just got the update and I can't even choose what song I want to listen to, skip songs I don't want to listen to at the moment or go back to a part I want to play again. it's frustratingðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• ALSO I HATE HOW IT AUTOMATICALLY SHUFFLESðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",NEGATIVE
Would be hard living without spotify.,NEGATIVE
"I have bad experience whenever I like to play the song, the aap is getting closed and the is stopped every time, can u pleas find a solution to it",NEGATIVE
Seriously the best variety of music!!,POSITIVE
without network music downloads and listening songs and music,NEGATIVE
The best Online Music App I've ever used. I'm happy you've introduced it in Kenya.,POSITIVE
Great music app hardly plays any ads but it sometimes pauses the music on its own and it can be annoying if you don't have premium. But overall it's a great app and I really would recommend it.,POSITIVE
Like the options the app has easy to add and remove from existing Playlist,POSITIVE
Good but there's a lot of ad :(,POSITIVE
Now that spotify has got lyrics for most of it's songs!! It's become way better!! ðŸ’žâœ¨,NEGATIVE
"Excellent service, much better than iheart.",POSITIVE
Tired of seeing COVID-19 tags nonstop simply because a podcast talks about it.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is one of the good app for listening music.. But suggestion of the next song is not based on my previous/similar intrest.. Hence you have to work on the Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning so that similar songs can be suggested to the music lovers.. Just check on the YouTube how they are suggesting the similar songs..,NEGATIVE
Just perfect.But ads where residuals and they can be removed by,NEGATIVE
Waw all features are good ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
It works really well bit the premium thing really makes it not worth it. U basically can't do anything without a premium account.,NEGATIVE
"At first Ioved this app! Until yesterday I set alarms with Spotify and it started to play random songs I have never played before. It does that when I click on a song too,I hope you can fix this problem.",NEGATIVE
The incessant prompt to join another person's session makes me want to drop spotify completely,NEGATIVE
Just my music when I what it. Albums as well as my favorite only. Make own Playlist/ multiple .,NEGATIVE
Works perfectly double thumbs up,POSITIVE
A very good music app with literally hundres of thousands songs! Personal playlist made daily and weekly automatically and always find what I'm looking for.,POSITIVE
I loved this app but it's been crashing so often that want to delete it!,NEGATIVE
It's very great from ganna... ðŸ˜ðŸ¥° and ganna is waste ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®,NEGATIVE
I don't use it a ton but it is good for my podcasts.,POSITIVE
Worst app ..not at all loading in 150mbos connection,NEGATIVE
Love the service but the mobile app keeps freezing then not allowing me to pause or anything. Have to restart my phone to get it to work again. Incredibly annoying,NEGATIVE
Couldn't log in at all. Kept telling me I'm offline even though I have a strong data connection.,NEGATIVE
Giving 4 because everything's going on good but I cannot add songs by hold press anymore,NEGATIVE
They charge me twice a month and won't stop when I ask them to. Terrible customer service.,POSITIVE
Some of my favorite songs are no longer available.,NEGATIVE
It was okay but then they updated it and all of a sudden I can only listent to my Playlist on shuffle mode. I also can't just listen to any song individually. They say it's free but you really have to buy premium to get anything good to come out of it.,NEGATIVE
Offline not supported.,NEGATIVE
Worst app I donno but everytime I play a song it suddenly stops working and I uninstalled this app then installed I update this app every time but again after one day it stops working . And this is happening with me from more than 6 months I am sure I'm not gonna install this app again !!!,NEGATIVE
"Works great have zero issues. I know its mainly used for music but fingers crossed they add a lot more books in the long run, already a good variety and abundance though so I'm rating 5 stars.",POSITIVE
"The app constantly stops during play. The user interface is not designed very well, from the swiping that advances to the next podcast, to the fact that I cannot organize my podcasts. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan only being on Spotify, I'd use another podcast app.",NEGATIVE
Best music app ever I'm enjoying it ðŸŽˆâ¤,POSITIVE
"I've been using Spotify since it came out, and have always prefered it over every other streaming service, highly recommend to my friend's and family, and highly recommend giving it a shot.",POSITIVE
"The only downsides of this app to me are the audio quality is not as good as the mp3 i have in my storage, and since 99.9% of my playlists are Japanese songs, i dislike how some songs are region-locked, which i still have to find resources to download.",NEGATIVE
I really like listening to podcast on Spotify,NEGATIVE
"Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries, as of October 2021. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre",NEGATIVE
Please add option to remove recently played,NEGATIVE
A Glitch keeps removing the play bar at the bottom and so i cant play or pause podcasts or music so i have to reset phone. Please fix this!,NEGATIVE
This music app good. This music app has alot of songs such as trending and old songs. It's have all the generation songs. In my opinion is this is a best app ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
Can you PLEASE have audiobook episodes excluded from the Blended Playlists with friends. Makes no sense,NEGATIVE
why my account haven't fitur canvas on settings? n i have done update to new version n still nothing:(,NEGATIVE
I love the app but the ads suck!,NEGATIVE
I enjoy all the choices and quality of the music!,POSITIVE
"considering how you're like a multi-billion dollar company, you wouldn't expect this app to be THIS bad. it's really laggy and crashes way too often. sometimes you try to search for a song but can't cause nothing shows up. and the main menu keeps loading for 7 years after opening the app every time. also; bring back the X on the perma noti. why would you even get rid of it? it's so much more troublesome getting rid of it without it.",NEGATIVE
"Pls fix the bug,went I play the song I want it plays other song",NEGATIVE
Best music app ever I recommend this app to everyone i know,POSITIVE
It's a good app and I like the fact that I get every song I want to..,POSITIVE
I'm giving it two stars because of a glitch Spotify has while sharing a song link to Snapchat. Like the song link is bizzarely placed with the image..... Usually when I was sharing I never had these problems but now it's too annoying. Like trying to place the link over the image is in itself a glitch. Please try to rectify it.,NEGATIVE
Good but advertisement,POSITIVE
this app would be amazing if it weren't for how many adds there are for non premium users its actually so bad i get 7 adds in a row sometimes in-between songs and the same add sometimes plays again straight after it was already played for some reason they are so frequent too and they always use the same exact adds for weeks on end and having to listen to those things so many times a day when i just want to listen to music is driving me insane i literally know them all word for word now,NEGATIVE
"I do like this app and I listen my favorite songs of every bands I listen. The problem that I encounter is the shuffle whenever listening to a song it's always change to other music or songs. Pls do something about this but I will still give 5 stars for this app. But, pls fix those issues and problems of Spotify.",NEGATIVE
I think it's the best app for listening music ðŸŽ¼ I really like it so much ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
It is a very nice app for listen musics and enjoying podcasts. We can also make playlist. Wonderful app,POSITIVE
"What happed to spotify? Constantly crashing. Stops playing. Cant stop it from playing, forsing me to close the app. Repeats the same content or song over and over. If i select another track, it dose it to that one. Dose it for android and iphone.",NEGATIVE
"This app is good and has all songs. Still I gave it 3 stars as the app is getting annoying day by day, it's ads are increasing making everyone crazy. Song-->Ad-->Song-->Ad",POSITIVE
The Spotify app is more user friendly.,NEGATIVE
"You promote guns to invade other countries, and you don't pay enough to the artists, Spotify sucks.",NEGATIVE
Fix the App it gets worse with every Update randomly pauses etc.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best.. enough said.,POSITIVE
Spotify is way better than Pandora,POSITIVE
"Watched a ""watch this for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" ad, hoping for an ad free shower. One song played, and when it was over it immediately played three ads back to back. Thought maybe it was a glitch, but when i heard at least two ads after every song, I knew I'd been lied to. This is the kind of thing I'd expect from YouTube, but I truly thought Spotify was better than that. Please, don't make me have to find a new favorite music source after at least 7 years of dedication to you!",NEGATIVE
"Ads! So many! They promised 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but sure enough, after 10 or so minutes there's at least 3 or 4 ads playing...",NEGATIVE
Please fix what is wrong with this app. It keeps stopping in mid play..I have uninstalled and installed very often. Getting sick of it.,NEGATIVE
Downloaded the app on my laptop but it keeps stopping. I did everything even logging out on other devices but still continued to stop worse experience,NEGATIVE
My downloads keep undownloading but besides that great app,POSITIVE
What I love most are the weekly playlists,POSITIVE
I love this Spotif music it has all my favorite songs,POSITIVE
"I REALLY LIKE THIS APP. But when i see it again it changed, when i touched to play it the music, it play just a little but when i play it shuffle the music is full. PLEASE fix this app again to the original we always use. :) We love it.",POSITIVE
"It keeps crashing. Also, it tells me to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions but then I'll hear a commercial within the next 5 minutes. Then it tells me again to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions... and then... another commercial within the next 5 minutes.",POSITIVE
Very easy to use and enjoying to listen music,POSITIVE
"Great music app. More enjoyable with spotify premium so theres no ads, but I feel like there could be less ads when you don't have premium. When you do an online mix, I think it's fine with ads to be on every few songs, but if your are listening to a playlist you made, i think there shouldn't be ads. And don't get me started on the limited skips. At that point I would just used YT music. I have been using premium for a while, so I don't know if the limited skips has been changed.",NEGATIVE
"The app is fine. But it's been 2 years and they're still showing ads during podcasts to premium users. If you want podcasts, go elsewhere unless you don't mind ads despite paying over $10 Canadian. If you only want music the app itself is easy to use and pretty intuitive. I found the ads excessive without premium, but no where near as bad as YouTube.",NEGATIVE
Overall Spotify has been a great way to listen to music. I love making playlists and listening to other stations and playlists too. Thank you!,POSITIVE
Nice App for music while you workout or go for a walk. Ads are not to bad and they only pop up every so often.,POSITIVE
One of the better streaming services.,POSITIVE
"It's unbelievable how often this app crashes, pauses for no reason, or simply refuses to load or play anything, including downloaded songs. The queues often dont function. And I'm skeptical that ""shuffle"" truly is shuffled at all, the same songs always come up. Truly just a trash app. Spotify employees should focus more on doing their job and spend less time complaining about content.",NEGATIVE
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this app. I've never had any issues with Spotify or anything like that.,POSITIVE
Exceptional but slow,NEGATIVE
Very good .....way better than audio mack......,POSITIVE
I really do like it but you adding songs to my playlist when it MY playlist I don't like how you just added songs without me verifying but other than that an ok app,POSITIVE
"Great app, love JRE. Only downside is it crashes on Android occasionally.",NEGATIVE
I love this app but every time there is ad why and once I think to take spotify premium but then there are so many ad i will not take premium please solve this problem every one song there is ad...,NEGATIVE
Love it but group session doesn't work rn so sad :(,NEGATIVE
Spotify is cool. Easy to browse,POSITIVE
Excellent. Very useful and enjoyable!,POSITIVE
I think its good i can feel the music its not free but its nice app,POSITIVE
"It's great to have an app for music, but the ads have become ridiculous! I'm getting four ads after one or two songs now and I can't afford the subscription currently... I really wanna know what happened to the 30 min ad free ""sessions"" that used to happen cause those were great for road trips.",NEGATIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
"Easy to use, great way to organize playlists, so much accessibility. Love it.",POSITIVE
"They say that this app is the front runner but it doesn't look so. The add to queue option is working in a very dumb manner. Whenever a song/ album/ playlist is required to be added to queue, it means to the end of the existing queue of songs. This is the logical thought for any layman. However Spotify adds songs next to the current song that is playing, this is a basic app mistake and i am thinking of cancelling the subscription i made. Hope they correct this basic mistake.",NEGATIVE
Incredible app. Easy to select songs and play,POSITIVE
Loved building a Playlist together for our romantic vacation.,POSITIVE
Wonderful and reliable app,POSITIVE
"""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" Time to next ad: 15.5 minutes. This is a small issue, but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription.",NEGATIVE
"I like how easy to use Spotify is. I've been on the family plan for a while, but when I wasn't, the ads weren't too bad or too frequent. I do prefer being on premium in order to control skips, which song is next, etc (idk what the perks are now, I've had premium for a while). I like the ability to have mixed playlists with my friends",POSITIVE
I love this app! U can make playlists by just searching an artist or song and I love the quality of the music. But I got few problems. I hate the limited skipping music and I hate when I'm listening to my music in the playlist and then suddenly it changes to a song who's not in the playlist and I don't even know the song. And I was searching for an app who can be free to listen to music offline. But on this app that's premium. I'll rate ur app 5 stars if you let us listen to music offline free.,NEGATIVE
Good but some music missing that I like,NEGATIVE
Excellent n easy to access music,POSITIVE
"I don't mind the app, the music side is okay, maybe a bit annoying at times but it's the free version so I can't complain. But I do have a problem with the podcast side of things. Recently it won't let me listen to anything, even the ones I've downloaded. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that hasn't done anything.",NEGATIVE
Good app ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ for listening ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘Œ music hope you all guy's enjoying stay blessed all â¤ â¤,POSITIVE
Too many bugs. I honestly might as well stick to YouTube because I get like 5 ads every 3 songs. The only thing that keeps me using this is the podcast and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app daily just to listen to them,NEGATIVE
"There's a plenty of problem in this app right now.First, whenever I click on the I wanted it's always different song. It's really irritating and when I play songs in my playlist it always comes out in different ways and another song comes in between. The older version is better than this one right now",NEGATIVE
the app always play the less popular songs..youtube is far far better... if a user asks for an artis.. then play the songs frm the artist.. dont play other songs from other singers... and play the top songs not the unknown songs.,NEGATIVE
Beneficial whilst having my long bath...listening to History of Rome padcast,POSITIVE
This app has helped me through so much. My playlist is almost 69 hours worth of music from all different genres. I find tons of new music I enjoy everyday. Spotify premium isn't very expensive and it's totally worth it. Spotify has quite literally saved my life. ðŸ’šðŸ–¤,POSITIVE
I will give 5 stars if you guys add the shortcuts with volume keys to skip tracks on the Galaxy s22 Ultra. Please add!!!,POSITIVE
Always has what I am looking for.,POSITIVE
"Songs have been stopping mid play for no reqson, i have tried everything from updating it to uninstalling and re-installing.",NEGATIVE
This ad after each song is so irritating,NEGATIVE
Too many advertisements,NEGATIVE
Alot of thought and effort put into the app and every feature. Pretty sure spotify knows me better than i know myself. I'd die before I switch to any other music playing application.,POSITIVE
"So far so good, I've enjoyed the app no issue...So I'm keeping the last star for me ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­",POSITIVE
Changed my comment since last time since more info came to light. However! You're the biggest music app on the planet. The bugs are starting to get annoying. Controlling another device shows a completely different song playing as example,NEGATIVE
"All good except ads. Ads are too annoying to be tolerated! The same ads are played in a loop. Now the app have become quite expensive in its way. Previously it used to give 3 months premium free for any premium pack, but now it reduced to 1 month.....",NEGATIVE
"App is crashing,fix this as soon as possible.After opening App get crahed. You have not fix the app crash.Not fixed yet. Usless appyou guys can't fix app crash.",NEGATIVE
Very nice application spotify,POSITIVE
Superb quality. Funtastic podcasts. And all the songs available.... In short entertainment at our earpods....,POSITIVE
"The ""premium"" algorithm is hot garbage. The UI is deliberately cumbersome and ugly, and for whatever reason the developers think that ""playlist"" means shove a bunch awful songs into a carefully chosen list constructed by a paying customer. Would never recommend this to someone who actually likes music. If you just wanna listen to Joe Rogan, I guess it's ok.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is my go-to app. Driving to work, at work, in the gym, cooking at home, cleaning you name it. Spotify is my jam. Hope they start implementing more videos like with Joe Rogans podcast",NEGATIVE
"You guys have to decrease the number of ads , it's like i usually listen to songs for about 1-2 hours continuously and Spotify increase the rate of ads per ad , for using this much long you better decrease the rate of adsðŸ™Œ",NEGATIVE
I enjoy the selection and the podcasts as a truck driver I listen a lot. The bad score is because I can't turn off autoplay. As soon as my phone connects the app turns on and starts playing and I will end up deleting the app if not fixed.,NEGATIVE
Too much ads like forever.,NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
It's good but I have my data on and says I'm offline when I alr fixed the MMS port on my side in the settings so pls do something.,NEGATIVE
The app is good. Can make a selection list itself,POSITIVE
"Ive been using spotify for a long time , and i usually buy the mini premium , but now i cant buy the mini premium because its always error or unable to reconnect , please fix this. Im from indonesia so i usually use a 3rd party payment such as ovo or gopay but it always says unable to reconnect and i have to buy premium mini from the spotify website rather than buying through the app.",NEGATIVE
I've been using spotify for years and find the app really amazing and well made. Yes I have come across some bugs and shortcommings throughout the years but nothing majour that hasn't been effectively resolved.,POSITIVE
Best app subscription for music,NEGATIVE
Most of the music of the world you can find. Student deals on premium are a blessing!,POSITIVE
Outstanding and best of the songs i love it,POSITIVE
Advertisement from McDonald's is disturbing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. I don't know if I'm telling someone who can hear me to fix that Please...,NEGATIVE
People often complain about too much ads but i am using it since a week and only got 3 ads overall it's a great app,NEGATIVE
I am using this app for many years now.. but recently I couldn't find the songs of a particular artist in their official playlist. Like there are only 8-10 songs when they have made many songs. Please fix this!,NEGATIVE
Xlent but rarely it simple shows no internet connection ðŸ¥±,NEGATIVE
Lots of glitches lately like I can't scroll sideways on the ganra selector in my liked playlist,NEGATIVE
Amazing Experience But could you just provide a song recognition featureðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
It's gud free songs but when we search for one song it gives us whole album..can't play one song only,NEGATIVE
I like it. My car system wakes it up on my phone,POSITIVE
Music for me changed because of Spotify.,NEGATIVE
"Can you stop shaming people for not taking your premium? I am fine with ads in general, but your toxic and obnoxious advertising collection is something else.",NEGATIVE

Best music service ever,POSITIVE
"I really love Spotify but at the same time I also love Pandora I have been using Pandora for a while they have 1HR of ad free music Spotify only had 30 minutes of ad-free music so maybe that's something that Spotify can match so speak also I do not like the fact that you cannot scroll back to see who you recently listen to just now I accidentally said I basically didn't like it because this artest cause I pressed some circle with a line through just keep it simple, its a give n take :/",NEGATIVE
Just so so easy.,POSITIVE
Not the ads but ok,POSITIVE

Spotify is a really popular music app it has a great variety of songs and it let's you make your own it has got all the artists I can think of I really recommend this app,POSITIVE
Spotify is a brilliant apps but it gives advertisement after every 2 song for the premium which is very irritating. I think u should the advertisement atleast after 10-12 songs .,NEGATIVE

I use this for work and this is very frustrating for this to happen!",NEGATIVE
Love the advertisement â¤..,POSITIVE
I dont like it . I picked a song I wanted and it keeps shuffling it it's just confusing,NEGATIVE
"Bro if your gonna increase the ad in between the music, and irritating people your gonna lose a lot of people. One add between 5-6 songs is okay and done. 2-3 ads btw 1-2 song is crusome. I love Spotify, so don't compel people into premium or else they will go in search of other music apps with free and less ad",NEGATIVE
"bug; when opening the app and playing music it will begin to play without a play bar, have to close the app and reopen to get it to function properly please fix edit: its doing this again pls make it stop",NEGATIVE

Nice app for all ever.so many songs many features i like so much these app THANKYOuu,POSITIVE

There are rarely songs I cannot find. Love it and use it every day for music and podcasts.,POSITIVE
"I'm the type of person who prefer Premium Mini for when I feel the mood to listen to music seamlessly for the whole day. BUT the process of purchasing premium mini through spotify is so frustrating it kept on ""unable to connect"" and I've been ""retry""-ing for half an hour. My signal is pretty good but spotify doesn't even let me try to pay for my premium purchase ðŸ˜©",NEGATIVE
Best app for listening to music and chill,POSITIVE
I love Spotify will always use,POSITIVE
Love it for my favorite podcasts,POSITIVE
it is really difficult to login and log ou into ur account from different devices,NEGATIVE
A lot of problems making suffer in this application,NEGATIVE
Spotify used to be great to use however these recent updates have not been great. I dont have access to my liked songs and it wont play songs outside the app :/,POSITIVE
"Easy to use, good recommendation so far.",POSITIVE
It doesn't play the full song you click on,NEGATIVE
Have to re download again as I try to play one album but after first song is done it plays a completely different mix. Not the first time and it's painful every time as I have to re download all of the songs I want to hear in low reception areas,NEGATIVE
"I can carry with me, My entire collection, the soundtracks of my life.",POSITIVE
"The issues I have are with its compatibility with Google assistant. Half of the time when requested to play something, it plays a completely unrelated song. For example for a while when asked to play Kelly Clarkson, it would actually play Kelly CARSON, a largely unheard of cover singer... it's quite frustrating when all you want is hands free compatibility.",NEGATIVE
great music selection and streaming quallity,POSITIVE
its the best i absoluty love it i love lisening to spotifi,POSITIVE
Nice app for listening song and podcast and funny things also,POSITIVE
Spotify mess up for me and won't work. It is so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
"Great Music App, but I think it will be even more better if developer adds a sort of Volume control in the app for the gamers who love to play music/podcast while playingðŸ¥°",NEGATIVE
"A couole things. First you used to be able to preview a song in the ""Add songs"" and now you can't. Second way too many adds for free listeners. Third if youre listening on any other device besides mobile for free listiners you have unlimited skips, repeat, can select a song and hear that song without having to skip to it, and your playlist don't automaticly shuffle. Yet on mobile you only get six skips per hour, no repeat, can't choose which song you want, and your playlist automaticly shuffle.",NEGATIVE
"I request utterly to change the dark theme, i am done with the dark theme player...",NEGATIVE
Perfect except I wish premium was priced maybe 5 instead of 10,NEGATIVE
This app is most likely in play musicðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
Complete trash of an app focused on harvesting data rather than maintaining a functional UI,NEGATIVE
I love the Daily Mixes and Podcast that Spotify suggests for me!,POSITIVE
Love the app. Great for listening to music.,POSITIVE
One of the best playlist ever made,POSITIVE
Great music have the ability to have ad free but if you choose not to if it do have an ad maybe one or two consider it to your style of music when she request a song it plays and bring up other songs similar to that stuff,POSITIVE
Friendly and easy to use... Great APP.... All the music you want. I totally Recommend it.,POSITIVE
I love Spotify its just sometimes when I want to play a song It will bring um an album that's kind of anoying but I've all love the app,POSITIVE
"The spotify experience has been amazing so far, it's additional function (lyrics) included in each music/podcast played by users make life easy.",POSITIVE
Spotify only Play adds,NEGATIVE
Each Time I play a certain song and even when I add it to my playlist. This is kind of annoying and I wish it can be fixed if it can.,NEGATIVE
I love this when I'm in a mood I have a Playlist that calms me down I turn that on and fall in love and relax/chill,POSITIVE
Payment for premium will not let me buy it and it keeps saying something went wrong,NEGATIVE
To many commercials. 10 dang commercials to get 15 minutes of music. WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ITS AS BAD AS REGULAR RADIO NOW,NEGATIVE
"Keeps crashing. When you skip ads it starts playing at a different place, basically I think just self sabotaging to force me to buy premium, which I never will.",NEGATIVE
"Only thing I would change is when I make a file of songs, don't put in suggestions. I made that file to listen to the songs I chose.",NEGATIVE
I just wish there weren't as many ads. Also if you share an account 2 people can't use it at once. But other than that it's a great app!,POSITIVE
"Fast pace life, play and go!!",POSITIVE
Hands down the absolute best And only Music App you will ever need. Phenomenal at predicting more favorites for you to listen to ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤,POSITIVE
"They need to fix the update like soon enough. A lot of songs that aren't in my fav songs are getting in whenever I shuffle, The only way I fix it by deleting spotify and downloading again. It is a pretty good app tho.",POSITIVE
Its been buggy as of late. Kinda annoying. Please fix.,NEGATIVE
Easy favourites and good suggestions,POSITIVE
new update since 6/22/2022 9 gigabytes of space on my internal storage with no option to move to my SD card which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Alot has been fixed otherwise since my last review in 2019 but would like to see the ability to move it to external storage.,NEGATIVE
The queue just doesn't work,NEGATIVE
I literally use it like every second of every day of my life I absolutely love it sm and it's even better with premium ðŸ˜©,POSITIVE
Very limited internationally,NEGATIVE
"One of my favourite, from discovering music to listening experience it has been a friend.",POSITIVE
Luv spotfy.luv alot Romantic slow music. That Spotify. Luv u ever made Spotify. B safe.,NEGATIVE
Easy to use. Great recommendations.,POSITIVE
Too many ads I mean if someone doesn't want to buy premium they just smash ads one after another.,NEGATIVE
Easy to find songs,POSITIVE
This app has amazing sound quality.but can't download music from this app and many as issues also after all good ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
"I pay to use this, and for the most part, no issues. It does occasionally skip to some other song, and it always wants me to go to car mode while in the car. Car mode is TERRIBLE! I always keep it off.",NEGATIVE
The best app in music but you should add sapne sajn ke too,POSITIVE
Love Spotify. It soothes my soul because l lifting up the name of Jesus with all of the different artist l listen too.,POSITIVE
"Get the family plan, it's worth it for a great experience.",POSITIVE
"Ãreas de mejora. Es muy necesario un buscador al momento de agregar canciones a una Playlist; para los que tenemos muchÃ­simas listas, es casi imposible encontrar una lista sin un buscador. URGENTE Improvement areas. A search engine is very necessary when adding songs to a Playlist; For those of us who have tons of lists, it's nearly impossible to find a list without a search engine. URGENT",NEGATIVE
It used to be so good but now I can never get it to work it always says no internet connection available but I have internet because I can use Google YouTube Instagram and everything but Spotify just will not connect to the internet,NEGATIVE
"Deleted songs. I pay for premium. I should have close to 3,000 songs but Spotify thinks because I don't listen to 'em I'm a certain time frame that I'll forget about them. I'll have some saved for over a year, won't listen to it and I come back and it's somehow unsaved AGAIN. I pay for premium so I can listen to music when I don't have signal for Internet. It's so dang frustrating!",NEGATIVE
Excellent selection; very intuitive when finding music for us based on our own choices; super fast downloads,POSITIVE
Spotify is a good app and all but recently I'll be listening to songs on my liked and then it will play songs that I never added nor have I ever heard off Is there a reason for this I'd like to know,POSITIVE
I love this it helps me when times are ruff,POSITIVE
It has most the songs you want to hear great app,POSITIVE
"Spotify is my most used and favourite app. I think of myself as a ""power user"" and I'm curious of how the Spotify team sees me. All this rating business to me is pretty tired. Having my phone ask to rate an app is something I simply don't care to do for the most part. I start to wonder, when will we move past this need to be better. When can we just let be what is. When can we transcend to a place where everyone has access to the best music all the time because we know music heals and is good.",NEGATIVE
"The best music streaming platform ever, it even comes with offline access to all the downloaded songs. Before it, l was missing out a lot, look at me now ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜all smiles.",POSITIVE
Been using it for years. Great app.,POSITIVE
Best app for music when you have premium!,POSITIVE
"App has gotten a lot better. Still prefer the old UI, but eh... What are you gonna do.",NEGATIVE
"Everything is good about Spotify. The best being that the app is always on night mode which reduces the strain on eyes, especially if you're like me who uses the music app like for the whole day. The only problem is that some songs and episodes are not available in your region, and I don't know why that happens. Overall, it's a must try app.",POSITIVE
"Unfortunately, Sharing songs on Instagram stories doesn't work, please fix this",NEGATIVE
I love it. I use it all the time. I do pay for it. I get the 3 month thing at Wal-Mart.,POSITIVE
"I've been using Spotify for years and I love it! It's super easy to navigate. But as of late the lyrics have stopped showing up on songs, from my understanding it's a glitch in the app but maybe I'm wrong. Another issue I've had, like many other's, is the ads. There are way too many and they put them in way too often.",NEGATIVE
Can't have a list of artists (based on saved songs) anymore,NEGATIVE
"I REAL-LY APPRICIATE A GOOD ,EMERGENCY RADII CHANNEL AND OR SPOTIFY EMERGENCY STATION RMERGENCY CHANNEL TURN ON.....I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE TRIPPING CORRECTLY AND AM COMPLETELY...""SOMEHOW... ...""INVOLVED WITH A VERY BIG ********((((((***)))*****,******************************,***********))))))))SHOWBUSSINESS((((((********************CROWD CONTROL...ANSWER AND TOP,TOP PRIORITY ,AND TOP TOP SECRETS,ANSD SECRET SECRET EMERGENCY...OF AGE,AND TIME,AND...DATES BIOHAZARDS KNEW....THAT,THE SURVELLANCE,A",NEGATIVE
"I don't mind the ads (I've long since become used to it) but it's just so LOUD? The normal music I'm hearing is like on low / medium volume then the ads come on and tries to break my eardrums! Really, it's like someone is talking normally next to you then suddenly a kid starts screaming loudly in your ear for a minute, CONTINUOUSLY.",NEGATIVE
"Really like this app for music, but I'm sad that you can't download single songs from off of an album. You used to be able to do that, but with one of the later updates that changed. Please bring that option back.",NEGATIVE
A great range of music and podcasts. I've never seen Spotify down. Worth the price of 2 mugs of coffee each month.,NEGATIVE
"Unable to play anything at all, or even find a single item of musical interest to me. I have no idea what I am doing wrong, and simply don't care. Your app is idiotic. Looking for the unsubscribe link, but you've made that impossible to find too.",NEGATIVE
This is a very good app please download it and enjoy music,POSITIVE
Canceled my premium and they charged me AND when I checked if I even got premium I DIDNT so they stole my money ðŸ˜ unbelievable. But app is good and works great but I'm actually mad about the stealing thing like I had to contact my cashapp n stuff and now im waiting to see if there's something I can do about it,POSITIVE
It is the worst but the songs are good!Â¿,POSITIVE
Perfect place to search olden music,POSITIVE
If you like music you'll love Spotify !,POSITIVE
I enjoy listening to various talented artists. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"It's good, but that doesn't mean I like it that much. You can only skip 6 songs an hour, the playlists are completely random, and they add random songs to playlists. That's just a bit annoying, I think. Also, you can get rid of those problems by paying? That's a cash grab up there with, like, Bethesda, dude. Still, it has access to every song imaginable and plenty of great podcasts. It's basically a good app if you don't the interuptions.",POSITIVE
Awesome music app. Spotify as everything I want to listen too.,POSITIVE
That one thing you didn't know you would be lost some kind of way without. Music for the soul child in me feel found.,POSITIVE
Not to bad premium is overpriced and no deal for students in Australia at high school.,NEGATIVE
"Constantly plays irrelevant songs to my playlist, and I can't seem to have songs play from a specific artist, only some mix (which includes anything BUT the artist), and I can't play a song in my liked queue nor close the app or else it'll play a new, irrelevant song.",NEGATIVE
This is so awesome to used because I get to listen to anything I want it is the best but there is one problem can you please put it as much skipping as we want. Please,NEGATIVE
Very useful all music I wanted choose no problem,POSITIVE
"Adds random songs, doesn't play my play list, hides songs, adds every 4 songs, ads all the time, not just 30 minutes",NEGATIVE
App is really great an amazing always working great a few times there is a few problems but other than that it's perfect,POSITIVE
"I hate this with all my heart this app is sooooo stupid because you have a limit to how many songs you can skip and I'm just trying to listen to the songs I LIKED and it just decides to give a similar song if I like a song I will like it of not don't give me those songs I can't even listen to like 3 songs before it gives me a ""similar"" recommendation it is sooo stupid and I thought that I selected a setting to make it stop and it didn't Spotify on phone is so stupid",NEGATIVE
Very buggy app. Tons of ads which are also broken (it says after the ads 30 mins of uninterrupted and then 5 mins later you get ads again). Constant issues with performance and premium is now unaffordable. Seems to be getting worse and worse. Do better Spotify.,NEGATIVE
After every 2 songs ads ðŸ¤¬ can't even enjoy the music because of ads ðŸ¤¬,NEGATIVE
"Super glitchy :((( Always crashing, never shows the play menu so you can't control what you're playing. Consistently having to uninstall and reinstalling just to get it to work, sometimes multiple times a day",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify works great and $10 a month for premium isn't to bad either I'd recommend it for sure,POSITIVE
All mu favorite songs are there and wheb i got this phone the app was their all ready and it was no money for me,NEGATIVE
"This app is bs after the update... my phone won't work on it says I need internet connection. Why the eff am I paying for an app that won't work. Duck this, go to YouTube premium... lifelong subscriber to spotify but it ridiculous now... DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM",NEGATIVE
Horrible. Can't go back in a song or Listen to a specific song without premium. unless you have the funds for a premium account it's absolutely not worth it,NEGATIVE
Very helpful to listening of music,POSITIVE
Very good app to listen to music especially when you have premium,POSITIVE
"Spotify used to be great for listening to music. Unfortunetely they are forcing randomized play unless you are a premium subscriber. The premium service offered is worth, at most, $2.99/month, not $9.99",NEGATIVE
"Ok I love the app and all, but recently the new update is absolute garbage if you don't have premium. There's an ""add songs"" feature and usually you can listen to their 15 second preview to determine whether it's good enough to add but they TOOK IT AWAY? Update: THEY ACTUALLY PUT IT BACK YAY",NEGATIVE
took money twice but didnt give premium(chutiya app),NEGATIVE
Price plans are too expensive and artist aren't given enough share of income just listen with ads until Spotify support artist fairly,NEGATIVE
"This is literally the most savage way off forcing people to buy premium. You can not listen to the songs you want (which is literally the whole point of such apps) because it will only shuffle through playlists, giving you 6 free skips until you can't skip songs anymore. On desktop you can do everything you'd expect for FREE! But here they just want to rip you off. Screw this company! Better do something good with your money than spend it on premium for features your media player already has.",NEGATIVE
Great music and plays your favorite list of artist.,POSITIVE
"Im just trying to listen to the music i want. I dont want to listen to some other songs i dont like. I had to watch tutorials on youtube ""How to listen liked songs on spotify""",NEGATIVE
I used the free version before deciding on going premium and it's the best decision I could've done. Now I've been on premium for 6 or 7 years now !! Would definitely recommend going premium if you can ðŸ«¶ðŸ½,POSITIVE
good quick source of music,POSITIVE
Why can't I remove a song from a Playlist on the fly? And why can't I put a song on the shelf for a while like w Pandora?,NEGATIVE
Ty I enjoy music ðŸŽ¶ on Spotify.,POSITIVE
Sometimes the app just skips to the end of the podcast after an advisement. Now I have to scan through the podcast to find where Spotify decided I had to move on but fought back. If Joe Rogan wasn't on this app I would NEVER use it.,NEGATIVE
"The worst app I've had to use, love spotify but what's the point if I can't ever use it. I pay for premium just for the app to be nonfunctional for half the month because either my phone or spotify updated and now it just doesn't work. Nope still broken",NEGATIVE
I don't know what is happening but i can't play songs online and I can't download my playlist. Help me,NEGATIVE
"Great selection, easy to ise",POSITIVE
The app is excellent but we need an update for the audio quality,NEGATIVE
I love this app because it has all my favorite songs on it.,POSITIVE
"I can handle my playlist by myself easily , just ðŸ˜ â¤ loved it",POSITIVE
"""Your Offline..."" UHH NO I'M NOT!! HOW COME 'YMUSIC' IS FREE FROK YMUSIC.IO AND WORKS!! And this app is constantly broken!!? I'm connected it works!",NEGATIVE
Don't download unless you're paying for premium If you're listening for free you'd only get frustrated trust me ðŸš®,NEGATIVE
"22 Jun 22, Spotify bluetooth works well on new Galaxy phone, but is not working on Pixel 4 XL. 7 May 22, Spotify needs a change of management like Twitter! For 2+ years now, Spotify videos do not play on Android devices while connected via Bluetooth regardless of Bluetooth device. 16 Feb 21 update: Struggling on Spotify !!",NEGATIVE
"I really like using this but of recently I've not been able to pay for the premium package, I want to, but it keeps declining my card, i would really like you guys to look into this",NEGATIVE
Spotify is DOPE!ðŸ’¯,NEGATIVE
"I enjoy the music. It's my first time to use it, I am loving it already. I have my playlists, of songs I love, following each other without interruption ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„",POSITIVE
Needs more music in Spanish,NEGATIVE
Nice way to find good music!,POSITIVE
"The app isn't bad, however there are several issues. Firstly, you can make a playlist of songs you want, however you can't choose which to listen to, but have to play shuffle, and even then you either play shuffle again or skip a song (6 skips every hour is ridiculously low amount) to get to what you want. After every song there are 3-4 ads. I understand it is a free service, but considering artist are barely even payed, this is ridiculous. Overall would just recommend downloading songs instead.",NEGATIVE
I love listening to music on here. I have given it a 4 star because of 2 reasons 1) there is adds all the time. 2) you can't listen to it offline. I would be more joyful (to me) if we didn't have adds all the time and we can listen to music offline. Apart from that it's amazing.,POSITIVE
"Really good experience with Spotify, but sometimes the bar to pass to the next song just disappear and I have to reset it",NEGATIVE
It's good but why can't we play offline music,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a great app; a one stop shop for good music with inbuilt lyrics to help anyone sing along. My issue however, the personalized playlist should be more flexible. People should be able to play a particular song at will instead of the shuffle play.",NEGATIVE
Love it so far i can type in artist and fet all their songs i love.,POSITIVE
Excellent app for all all occasions and moods,POSITIVE
Super and real time,POSITIVE
App not running on wifi.,NEGATIVE
It's amazing sound feeling I love it spotify ðŸ™ƒ,POSITIVE
Great! Only complaint is that I still get notifications for podcasts I don't listen to anymore but I'm sure there's a setting or something I've missed.,NEGATIVE
It takes minutes to start any podcast,NEGATIVE
Can't seem to do downloading og songs,NEGATIVE
Crashes all the time,NEGATIVE
Streaming skips on Fold 3. Not even usuable,NEGATIVE
"Outstanding! Out tastes are all over the place! Incredibly everything we looked for my spouse and I found ! Philippe & Marta Monbaron. Czech, Swiss and South African.",POSITIVE
"Spotify sucks, for so many reasons. But for consumers, it sucks because the shuffle mode doesn't actually shuffle anything. It just chooses songs you've heard a million times, or songs that are most popular. They have no plans to fix this issue. I wish I could give you 0 stars.",NEGATIVE
Fine playing but can't download,POSITIVE
Everytime I try to listen to My Playlist it plays some random songs that I haven't added and if I try to skip it I run out of Skips because I have free Spotify it's not that I don't have enough songs on my playlist I have over 150 W I can't listen to them and I have to listen to some other stuff,NEGATIVE
Spotify my main music app they focus on both side of the cellphone spectrum with good quality sound,POSITIVE
Becoming very slow to load,NEGATIVE
Just too much of advertisement. Which gets irritable.,NEGATIVE
"Please help I can't seem to get lyrics for any song,even after updating",NEGATIVE
Paying for premium and getting publicity all the time,NEGATIVE
All we need is no ads,NEGATIVE
Love the Playlist,POSITIVE
"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it.",NEGATIVE
Newest update has issues. Sometimes I'll leave the app open in the background and music will just stop randomly. Sometimes on shuffle the app will somehow lose track of what song is playing and it'll play 2 different songs at the same time. Closing the app with 2 songs playing and one song will continue to play despite me closing the app completely and there no way to stop it,NEGATIVE
It quite working an I can't use. It.,NEGATIVE
I have no problems with it and they have all the music I've been looking for,POSITIVE
"This is an app that is impossible to run freely, so get premium it's worth it having your own library to play whenever you want. But my issues is Spotify's attitude toward musicians who get paid little from this service and choose to leave. Between YouTube music and this, YouTube Music is superior because EVERY artist and song is there.",POSITIVE
The best app for Spotify,POSITIVE
You give sooo many ads...can't even listen to songs peacefully,NEGATIVE
The app switches to ads about 5 mins in and then restarts or moves to the next podcast in the list. Garbage. UPDATE: Half a year and it still randomly crashes and shuts off my podcasts...,NEGATIVE
Great Music! Great Access!,POSITIVE
Too many songs that I love are banded? Or not available on spotify!Spotify!! There are remixes that the artists even publish themselves but for some reason Spotify doesn't allow to play? Some amazing songs on tiktok.. and spotify cannot keep up :( will probably discontinue use,NEGATIVE
"Thanks to Spotify, I've learned the band names, which radio shows rarely disclosed, and by it's suggestions, has opened me up to bands I'd never even heard of before. So happy with it!!",POSITIVE
Best music app I have ever used,POSITIVE
I love Spotify. Every song I wish to listen to is there. Great app,POSITIVE
It's awesome platform for music.,POSITIVE
Love the availability of music and the selection,POSITIVE
Very good and i love the app But the fact that it doesn't shuffle and plays an artist song is what i don't like,POSITIVE
Not able to block other apps from disrupting music,POSITIVE
"Content is okay but my music pauses constantly when app is playing in background. This just recently started happening and I have tried all of the ""fixes"" suggested by spotify. Very annoyed to be paying for premium and having an app that glitches all the time.",NEGATIVE
"Good music selection sucky app... I have a lot of my favorites on here but the app is so glitchy! Half the time it will just randomly pause and you then have to close out the app and re open it. If you don't it will pause off and on faster. Sometimes it seems it works better with the app open with the phone unlocked... It acts like free YouTube sometimes, difference is I pay for this so I would LOVE to lock my phone and it not freeze up even more.(I would do less stars but it has a lot of music)",NEGATIVE
"Ever since their last upda5e I don't have the little menu you can toggle with the sing that's currently playing to fast forward/pause/ etc which is pretty annoying, music also glitches out all the time, stops playing randomly. Seems every update I'm missing another feature that use to be there...",NEGATIVE
Way to much ads,NEGATIVE
Great app best music streaming app out there does everything I want at a great price .,POSITIVE
Best songs collection and UI,POSITIVE
Better collection of songs than gaana or interface is very realistic and smooth color.,POSITIVE
"You know, just the best music app.",POSITIVE
Love this app i hear Any Sound,POSITIVE
I want it to enable us to skip songs with no ads,NEGATIVE
Spotify double charged me for a year and a half and I didn't notice. One month last year they charged me 4 times on the same day. I canceled my subscription in November 21 and they continued to charge me. The only reason I noticed any of it was because I was looking through my transaction history. I am not impressed and will definitely be deleting my account. Not to mention I've been going back and forth with the customer service representative for days. They do not have a phone number either.,NEGATIVE
It a nice app...it has useful notifications plus the lyrics when the song is playing it good app...it not giving me problems I like it,POSITIVE
"I've used Spotify for seven years I believe and the only issues I had were on my old phone when it would tell me my playlist wasn't downloaded when it was then when I got wifi again, it went back to saying it was downloaded. That's the only issues I've had.",NEGATIVE
user interface deteriorating after each update. deserves less than one star,NEGATIVE
Got me through the boring and tedious days of school also it helps me sleep at night. Over all the service it provides is phenomenal.,POSITIVE
a friend at work who told me about Spotify I recently downloaded it and I LOVE SPOTIFY it's the BEST MUSIC PLAYING APP I've ever seen or used in ALL my life I deleted iHeart and Pandora because this is so GREAT AND FANTASTIC because I can save entire albums of my Favorite Rock and Country bands I Truly Love to listen to whenever wherever I want there's nothing better than Spotify in my Opinion for Good I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY,POSITIVE
Only some of the music one wants to listen to are available,NEGATIVE
Lotta ads but perfect otherwise.,POSITIVE
Love that I can find and play all my favorite music,POSITIVE
"Easy to navigate have always had the artist I asked for, reliable",POSITIVE
i love this app. i have been with Spotify for over 10 years.,POSITIVE
It makes listening to Joe Rogan a painful experience. It resets on me and I have to find my spot atleast four times a podcast. The only conceivable reason to use Spotify is the Joe Rogan contract. Iheart radio and youtube music are superior in every way. The only way it could be worse was if it crashed on startup.,NEGATIVE
Spotify used to be a brilliant app and I have always enjoyed listening music on it but this new update is simply pathetic. It is now only usable for premium users. Non premium cannot even listen to the music of their own choice without shuffle. I cannot rewind or repeat the song and have to bear the playlist I don't want to listen.,NEGATIVE
"Quality is good, but there are so many commercials! I want to workout with music, but the interruption mess up my workout.",NEGATIVE
"Stops playback on the paid version, every other song or so ...mid song it stops, that's how I know to update the app! After the new update, I restarted my phone and it continues to stop.",NEGATIVE
Good app. Very impressed with it,POSITIVE
"App not working after last update, it's automatic stop to playing song and out",NEGATIVE
"Good but not enough, there is a lot of trouble when you are conected to other devices through the website or even from my mobile device, some issue with connection to music library and the app is not able to play any song for a long time-frame, already update and reinstalled the app, but is the same issue and then suddenly starts working again",NEGATIVE
Fairly simple to use but for some reason occasionally the equaliser function goes a bit wonky and stops working.,NEGATIVE
"It's chock full of ads, other streaming services are much better in that aspect. Every one to two songs there are two 30 seconds ads.",NEGATIVE
Worst app ever...i purchased premium duo twice to listen song with my friends.. In mobile app it show your package is active and in web it say no package purchase.. are you guys high or what? If you want free money just beg. Don't make stupid app's or just for once fix the issues.,NEGATIVE
"Did the update but downloaded music had to re download again so I pay $9.99 a month just to download music each month is not worth the $9.99 anymore not a good app to use anymore you lost my subscription,.",NEGATIVE
"The app gives free users no freedom, unlike the computer version.",NEGATIVE
Installed bit won't even open. Checked online it takes my credentials and credit card details but won't log me in in the app. Great.,NEGATIVE
I did't get contnue music of any playlist and i have to choose music. So plz solve this,NEGATIVE
"Love it, my daughter enjoys a lotâ¤ï¸",POSITIVE

"Great, but can't skip when I wanna ðŸ˜Ÿ",POSITIVE
Cool app but some songs are no loaded,NEGATIVE
"The app is really faulty offline. Even though I have downloaded my playlists, they still don't load when I'm not connected to the internet. I have to close and reopen the app at least 2 or 3 times.",NEGATIVE
Songs all are better. But they dont give importance to kannada songs like other language songs. So thats why i am giving 2 star,NEGATIVE
Podcast still not available,NEGATIVE
Hey can you add the feature to move songs up and down in a playlist trust me it gets frustrating when you cannot play your favourite songs one after other when you add new songs. The desktop version has it so why the smartphone doesn't have the feature. If you add the feature 5 stars from me.,NEGATIVE
Spotify>apple music Premium is hella worth it,POSITIVE
Still thinking more serious about Premium..,NEGATIVE
"I can't even play 3 songs without the app crashing every 10-15 minutes. It's getting really frustrating. I'm a Premium member, but it feels like I paid the subscription for NothingðŸ™„",NEGATIVE
This makes you feel better when you are not feeling ok means when you are sad it can easily make you happy by songs. There are also sad songs but it is very satisfying app. I like it very much. After downloading this app you will be very happy. Thanks for makin this app.,POSITIVE
"Have been using this app for years, just recently it took away the option of hearing snippets of songs when making playlists, which was one of the things that made it a superior music app. If that option were to come back it would definitely be a five-star experience!",POSITIVE
"It's really good â˜ºï¸ ,but i just wish we could download music instead of listening ðŸŽ§",NEGATIVE
The music is awesome!ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
It's really a good app I love it coz it doesn't contain alots of ads,POSITIVE
"Generally works great. But many times I've used the app the screen freezes, or control bar desappears and I need to quit app for it to appear again. Also, doesn't work well while traveling with google maps directions... it attempts to share screen and map doesn't work well",NEGATIVE
Love to listening music it makes my day to make me more confidence to think in positive and make plan for my future ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Wonderful experience, you guys should provide an avenue to download and listen offline. It will help a lot",POSITIVE
Upload Connection Error Log,NEGATIVE
"It's a brilliant app for streaming musics, listening to songs, podcasts and audiobooks, stories etc..",POSITIVE
"Spotify used to connect automatically to my Pioneer head unit in my truck but that functionality stopped back in February I believe. I've been holding out hope that it would be fixed but so far it hasn't. My device used to show up automatically in the Windows app regardless if i had Spotify open on my phone or not, but that stopped at the same time. Audio quality and auto-generated playlists aren't as good as other streaming services. Update: they fixed it, and then broke it again. Shame!",NEGATIVE
Very good app easy to use great variety of music ðŸŽ¶ I listen to my music all day.,POSITIVE
It is amazing that you can listen to music and not get hacked on your account,POSITIVE
"Its really amazing ðŸ˜ Such a wonderful experience on this music streaming app, love it",POSITIVE

"I Will Give 3 Star On This App. Because Some Little Issues In This App. Like Ads, Network Loading, Premium Etc. I Will Request To The Owner. Please Fix The Little Problem. Bit This App Is Really Nice. And All The Songs Are Available On This App.",POSITIVE
Beat app ever... Thank you I enjoyed alot...,POSITIVE
"I found the app OK on consoles and pc but on phone the standards slip, it plays the songs on my playlist but when its done it plays songs that they added to my playlist and doesn't go back (yes I did turn off the autoplay button)",NEGATIVE
It's a great app but I wish I could download music,POSITIVE
Not good having problems logging in,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy this app . It's great listening to so many different genre ðŸ˜Œ,POSITIVE
Randomly starts playing ads (not even music) when I'm sleeping. Deleting this annoying app. And youtube music is much better!,NEGATIVE
I love the many varieties of music and no commercials! I recommend this app to everyone!,POSITIVE
Really a stupid app. It asks for logging in when sometimes I have enabled offline mode and i go out of internet. I mean i enabled offline mode so i cud play without internet right?,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and you can find any tunes you want,POSITIVE
Huge variety of songs... Great sound quality,POSITIVE
It's annoying because it stops playing in the middle of a song. Sometimes only 5 seconds into a song. Fix it!,NEGATIVE
"it is easy to get on this app. and alot of music that i like. it works real good, no problems.",POSITIVE
"It tells me 30 mins no ad music and while im working out 10 mins later an ad,false advertising",NEGATIVE
Good Music Sound Quality,POSITIVE
"Spotify is fine except when ur a free listener. It gives u limited skips, adds random songs to your Playlist, gives u ad after ad after ad, and it just ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using spotify",NEGATIVE
Wonderful app for music loversâ™¥ï¸,POSITIVE
The best Music Application.,POSITIVE
"I like the playlists, I like the amount of songs and artists. I absolutely HATE the free version as you basically have no control over choosing songs or playlists anymore and you get 2 songs and 4 ads. You're being forced into paying for the subscription because they make it annoying enough. I'd rather go to YouTube or Amazon music.",NEGATIVE
"I have not had a problem with this app until now, It just updated about a week ago and I found that all my playlists in app were empty. And spotify made playlists were too. Nothing will play. And on the web player everything is normal. I tried this newest update, just a moment ago and nothing is fixed. Good job. ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
"Good app, but yall made a terrible decision removing the preview button. Who thought that was a good idea?? â€œOh, yeah. It would be a great idea removing the preview button so others cant find new songsâ€ðŸ’€ I cant even find new songs to add to my playlist because of that. What was the point of removing it? Add it back, please. Also, I hate how you guys add random songs to my playlist while im listening, I never asked for that. But seriously, please add the preview button back.",NEGATIVE
"This app is great, the music is great although there is one problem, the app is messed up, like when I try to play the song I try to play it just shuffles to the song I don't even wanna play, it's fricking annoying and it's so annoying I wanna smash my phone so hard just because of the music I wanna play, please add ""Shuffle off"" button so I can shut this thing off, I really wanna play ""Bubble gum"" by Clario.",NEGATIVE
Best clear song app but app sound slow please fix thoda,NEGATIVE
Greatest app ever for streaming songs,POSITIVE
Very bad need to listen to a song but it is only contains add add add add add add add add add,NEGATIVE

Only thing I use to stream any music. Had the paid for version but had to cut it as I couldn't afford it any more.,NEGATIVE
Audio quality is exceptional,POSITIVE
Excellent Online Music Platform....... And it also needs some improvements... Overall I loved it....,POSITIVE
"Ads are fine but please, please let me choose a song",POSITIVE
"Amazing that this app has been out for almost a decade and there is still no way to organize your music library by genre. You also can't collaborate on playlist with a specific user, so get ready for bots to put random songs on your collaborative playlists. The app doesn't run well on new phones or old phones. Artists don't get compensated fairly and the CEO is a war profiteer. I'm switching to Tidal, which means I'll lose years worth of playlists, but it's definitely worth it.",POSITIVE
It's a great app for music lovers! Would recommend this.,POSITIVE
To difficult to turn app off. Considering uninstalling,NEGATIVE
"If you ain't paying for it, might as well go screw your self. It gets worse as the months go by. I only use the god awful app for 1 flipping podcast, and i have to un-reinstall 10x/podcast. Can't wait for Rogan to move platforms",NEGATIVE
Why does every other app in my phone have a better audio quality than Spotify..........? And I have a premium account I often wonder if I should cancel and just get YouTube music.,NEGATIVE
Organized well thought out music service,POSITIVE
Ahhhhhhhhhh I think Spotify is the best approach when it comes to listen full full album,POSITIVE
"Well, I've been using the Amazon Music app that is about ten dollars a month. Spotify is way more up my alley. Lots easier to populate your lists. Helpful suggestions. High bit rate sounds great! The thing is, I'm listening to classical music.",POSITIVE
"The new update sucks. It won't actually let me listen to my playlists anymore. I made a new playlist this morning and instead of letting me listen to it, it started playing the recommended songs and there's no way that I've been able to find to make it stop. There's also no way to turn off shuffle. It won't let you click on specific songs in your playlist anymore and the daily skips have lowered by a lot. Did I use up a free trial of premium or something? Because I did not sign up for one.",NEGATIVE
New update are so trash lmao only 6 skip per hour ? This is music app or game ???? We use to listen why you don't let me chose a song that i want to listen ??,NEGATIVE
After last update there is a problem in chrome cast please fix it,NEGATIVE
Busted for 2 days now. Playlist won't load.,NEGATIVE
Everytime an ad comes on it dosen't make me want to get premium. It almost always makes me want to delete my account.,NEGATIVE
"I don't know if y'all would answer the solution for this, but I've been utilizing this music source for nearly 2 years now, had enjoyed every single thing until the last update. Firstly, lot of songs I've played recently depicted a whole different track or album's cover, which made me hard to distinguish what song is. Secondly, specifically lastly, why do some songs have a lag, even if I've downloaded it? I've never experienced this before. Please fix this immediately.",NEGATIVE
It's a good app and has all of music I would want but when I first downloaded it I had to immediately update because the app wouldn't even open.,NEGATIVE
Love this app !!! Can pick my favorite songs and enjoy whenever I want to!!! â¤ and thanks to the Spotify team ðŸ˜€,POSITIVE

"Love all the Playlist I can create, the variety of content and the ease of using this app.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify I was an apple music subscriber not anymore,NEGATIVE
I'm starting to think Amazon music better suits me. They play what I like without me choosing,NEGATIVE
This platform is really awesome but premium is little bit higher In price so that yt music is more Better option than that because of affordable price with video features and minimal primium range one premium for everyone .,POSITIVE
Enjoy the largest collection of music with excellent quality and inbuilt adjustments of the app,POSITIVE
When I go on to my play list it will play a completely different song so can you change that thanks,POSITIVE
Too much ads. Sometimes feel like to deleating it.,NEGATIVE
Absolutely awesome....surely a must have app,POSITIVE
Basically Spotify is ruin sincr it wont even let you choose a song now it only play it for few second and then you only can skip 6 times per hour it just suck at this point ðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
"I've been using Spotify for years but I can't even log in anymore. The login system is completely messed up, you could log in using your email or Facebook on the web interface as both are connected to each other. The app version doesn't work like this, it straight up denies my email. You just simply cannot use your email to log in through the app if you made the account using your Facebook. The Facebook login is also broken for months now, the page says that the embedded page is down. Fix this!",NEGATIVE
It's good for playing your fave tracks for free if you don't mind the interuption of adds every so often. ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Usually I love this app, and I've been paying for premium for years, but this most recent update is messing everything up. The app just downright refused to work yesterday, no matter what I did. It's working slightly better today but still randomly stopped working on my morning drive to work which wasn't super convenient. Please fix the bugs from the latest update!",NEGATIVE
Best music app. Dont believe what others say try it then decide.,NEGATIVE
Mobile version navigation is AWFUL,NEGATIVE

"From like 2 or 3 months, this app is not working well and whenever I try to listen any songs,podcast and episodes, it shows that go to home page ! And I'm requesting you to please fix this bug or glitch as soon as possible ðŸ™",NEGATIVE
Having problem evey time when I try to login and some times show network error in search section. Please solve these problems ðŸ˜’ And there is too many adds.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is all and more than I could want for my musical exploration and enjoyment.,POSITIVE
You'll love it! A whole wide variety of music that can be found!!!,POSITIVE
So nice but if you can just make it easier to search the songs thanksðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Worst music app can't play music that I want,NEGATIVE
Very good variety. Only complaint is repetition of some songs when there is a comprehensive playlist,POSITIVE
"On my old phone (Xiaomi Mi 8), the equaliser worked perfectly fine. Now, on my Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, it doesn't work at all. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
This good sound..lovabail aap good experience in the sound of the day of yourself and you are not able to be a dark life of you and your family is good and I love this good sound,POSITIVE

Love making playlists,POSITIVE
"Caters to my music tastes, and gives similar bands to choose from. I like this app, can't believe I was so against it in the first place. It even let's me make my own playlists, easier than YouTube premium for sure.",NEGATIVE
"i would'av given a 5*, but since i'm relatively new to the spotify scene , i thought it disingenuous , there's always room for improvement in anything we do.., keep up the good work, and i might, this review, to edit, come back. ðŸ˜‰",NEGATIVE
"It's makes my life funner. Enhances my fun mode. It also brings joy to my friends and others ðŸ˜Š. Thank you for the service you provide. Heads up, you're better than pandora.",POSITIVE
No interruption from ads but a decent price as well as their bundles for family it's really good I recommend you to listen to music from here,POSITIVE
"It's okay so far, but not being able to listen to downloads offline is weird. All in all it's been excellent",POSITIVE
It's great to find music u like even though the ads are disturbing your mood ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
"Dum dum and I wanted to play a specific song and it gives me a whole random playlist which sucks, at least have a setting or something developers. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ Geez now I have to use YouTube music ðŸŽ¶",NEGATIVE
Nice and all but there's quite a lot of updates?,POSITIVE

"I've been using this app for years, and it had never failed me.",POSITIVE
"Any song I search for Spotify delivers, awesome",POSITIVE
Nice music app ever used..,POSITIVE
Spotify thinks there slick running adds after every two songs,NEGATIVE
Its an amaizing app. I love listening to music on it and i font get any adds.,POSITIVE
"Great App, but facing advertisements after every song on both my PC and my phone. Please lower the number of advertisements so that people who haven't brought premium also enjoy uninterrupted music for a limited time. For example: After an advertisement we can listen to uninterrupted music for 30 minutes or less or After ever 5 songs an advertisement will be played and after that we can listen to 5 more songs uninterrupted. Hope you take this in consideration. Thanks",NEGATIVE
It could be a great app if commercials wouldn't yell in your ear when you try to listen to some music after every 3 songs. I understand that a free version can't work as paid one but this is ridiculous and extremely annoying,NEGATIVE
I was very sattisfied from spotify until it started lagging whenever it felt like it not letting me listen to music. I have contacted customer service and nothing they suggested helped the situation. This has been going on for more than 2 weeks. If it doesn't get fixed I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with apple music.,NEGATIVE
"I like it . But here is one issue . I just want eng subtitles under the Korean or Chinese song lyrics. Eng subtitles are available in Samsung phone . So please, I'll be thankful if you clear this issue .",NEGATIVE
That is very good song lestining app.,POSITIVE
"I would like the paid version of this app to be available without commercials. Yes, the music is ad free, but the podcasts are not. Can you edit these out, please! 5 stars if you do.",NEGATIVE
"I am a Premium user but cannot play music when offline, though I downloaded the songs. And the app is always crashing. Kindly fix these issues. Thanks.",NEGATIVE
This is a must have if you enjoy ad free music.,NEGATIVE

"Very good app for listening songs,news,bhajans,prodcasts etc .",POSITIVE
Why is the social feature still broken? I loved seeing what all my friends were listening to and discovering new music that way. Please fix it and make it a more prominent feature.,POSITIVE
"I usually love this app but just in the past week or so, that problem of constant stopping mid-song randomly is back. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone and just did an update of the app this morning and still nothing. It's so frustrating that I'm using Pandora and YouTube instead, which is annoying because I pay for Spotify. If this isn't fixed quickly, I'm cancelling my subscription!",NEGATIVE
Lots of ads,NEGATIVE
"""Local"" songs get flagged as unplayable constantly, they dropped support for Kenwood / JVC head units, it uses far more data than it has any right to, syncs terribly and requires a lot of fuffing around to do basic functions. There's not much there worth your time - they've gotten the user base, and now they're complacent and no longer care about making the user experience any good.",NEGATIVE
I'll give a 5 stars if you can finally let me share lyrics on instagram.... THANKS! 5 STARS NOW,POSITIVE
Such and amazing app I love itâ¤ï¸ literally being used every day.,POSITIVE
Whenever I try to listen to a curtain song it plays a different one and also when I log on it makes me watch ads,NEGATIVE
Poeple are missing a great app,NEGATIVE
"I have been living with problems with Spotify and paying for it since February and they still haven't fix my problems. I'm told my case had been passed on to their executive level tech support, but they can't give me a date when my problem will be fixed or it it will be fixed at all. I haven't heard from anyone executives tech yet, it's 4/11/2020. Spotify don't care about their customers. They are only concerned with getting your money. I lost track of how many emails I have sent seeking help.",NEGATIVE
"'Hey slow down you have only 6 in one hour"" is rude. I should not receive that when I have not subscribed",NEGATIVE
"It's a very very good application for listening songs, podcasts, etc. I enjoyed very much with it. This is a special music listening application because it give us the freedom to make our own privet or public playlist. It's amazing.",POSITIVE
Terrible experience on mobile.,NEGATIVE
When I want to play my liked songs it instead play another song and when I play a song it's only for a while I hope it's fixed,NEGATIVE
"Very bad, o can't download to play offline. Why is that? At least I should be able to download to the App and play offline in the App. I am not enjoying it as I thought",NEGATIVE
You should try this app there is alot of beautiful song that you can listen all day and you can make playlist for music you like then shill with it all night ðŸ˜Ž,POSITIVE
Lot of ads,NEGATIVE
Spotify is great!,POSITIVE
Used to work great! Now it won't load the homescreen and freezes all the time!,NEGATIVE
Awesome app with almost all songs available from,POSITIVE
"Spotify is a good app to listen to music however it forces you to pay like nothing will function, I'm willing to pay it's not a big deal however my experience wasn't good while I didn't pay so I don't think it's worthy to pay for.",NEGATIVE
"All the songs that we paid till date should be ours not that app should just remove access from it, if we don't pay.",NEGATIVE
A great platform to listen to some great content.,POSITIVE
Cool app for us retired old geirzers,POSITIVE
Making 1 star until spotify removes their own ads from podcasts. The tone shift completely ruins them.,NEGATIVE
Best app using it from a long time but there's recently some issues. The song gets stops in the middle and suddenly it plays. It just hinders the joy of music. There's no issue with the network. I hope you'll consider my problem and work on it asap. Rest it's the best app for music...,NEGATIVE
Low ratings seem to come from the people who dont pay for it so... â­â­â­â­â­ -paid customer,NEGATIVE
"personally for me, this is the best music app out there. Automix, recommendations are top notch",POSITIVE
Great to use for excercise,POSITIVE
Too many ads and less skips,NEGATIVE
This app is the best app I think for listening music.....join premium and get uninterrupted music and have funðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,POSITIVE
Delivers the music I want but at the expence of artists who receive little revenue from this service! â˜¹ï¸,NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is very good app to listen music. Ads are fine even though it is irritating sometimes. But lyrics are not correct for most of the Tamil songs. It's all in Romanized version and spellings and pronounciation are wrong for everything. I suggest you to give lyrics for Tamil songs in Tamil like how you give the original lyrics for other language songs. It will be more appreciated. Thank you. Otherwise, Spotify is very good app.",POSITIVE
I love this app Spotify is very very good app ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ–¤ðŸ’–ðŸ–¤ðŸ’,POSITIVE
"Outstanding. No more carrying external hard drives, hybrid hard drives, solid state drives or memory sticks. The playlist you do for one is spot on.",POSITIVE
"It played 4 ads at once. Fix this issue. If this is intentional, please stop.",NEGATIVE
Was an amazing app now I can't loop any song,POSITIVE
"is it just me or not, after got 3 update my audio quality always like got stabbed by a knife. thats hurting my ears.",NEGATIVE
I love this app but.... why can free acc can't turn off the shuffle? I really hate this update for my opnions!!,NEGATIVE
"Excellent app for Music, great playlist recommendations",POSITIVE
Spotify gives the best feeling â¤ï¸ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
"Pros: Great listening experience, lots of connectivity options. Very useful autogwnerated playlists, discover weekly and most listened songs throughout the last year. Cons: Could offer more quality options for pasionate users.",POSITIVE
"No other music service compares, Premium is worth every penny if not more. The people who are complaining about the free side and giving low ratings don't seem to understand the potential in this service, Spotify has made small artists around the world more accessible than ever before. They've made a service where you can blend your own music tastes with people close to you to get a custom playlist updated daily based on your common music tastes. They're bringing people together wity music. ðŸ¤˜",POSITIVE
Its good but when now the daily mix is on shuffle.. please make the daily mix playlist not shuffle again : ),NEGATIVE
An utterly broken app. Anytime I try to listen to anything it tells me I'm not connected to the Internet. If I try to download anything it just shuts down. Piece of shite ðŸ¥´,NEGATIVE
"the best it is not bad, I love it because it lets you make your own playlist and it lets you put what whatever songs you want on a certant playlist",POSITIVE
This application is very good I highly recommend for you to listen to music while relaxing,POSITIVE
"it takes too long to load when my wifi works just fine, i dont have any problems with the rest of how the app works",NEGATIVE
"I use premium, but j hate how unusable free is, like u can't actually specifically choose a song to play and I hate that",NEGATIVE
its good but after update i couldn't see the lyrics anymore..,NEGATIVE
Disgusting update. Too many advertising,NEGATIVE
"Asife from the exorbitant amount of bugs (music not playing, controlling other devices only works half the time, etc.), There's several missing features like a proper shuffle (or a switch for it), themes and proper folder support (how hard can it be? It's already mostly implemented). Also, when playing a radio, the shuffle button isn't shown but it does still apply to the queue.",NEGATIVE
So many ads i went to listen 1.50 minute song but i had to listen 1 minutes 9f ads what the worth gaana is better the you im shifting,NEGATIVE
Ever since I stopped using premium it's been being kinda odd like the format like bro spotify u got favriotes or something ðŸ¤”,NEGATIVE
I gave it 4 stars because 1. Ot doesn't pay for the usage of artists songs but I also gave it 4 stars becuade it has Mr. Ballen podcast on it and he's the king of true crime stories,POSITIVE
"i started using this app over pandora back in 2013? Only beause you could make playlists, thats it. I love listening to music but this app has more ads than before. I get that ads make the world go round, but why so many like 3-4 in a row and after every other song. I hear more ads than music on this app anymore. Instead of jamming out to music i am now jamming out to ads about tourism in the same state i live in!! Atleast YT lets you skip an ad.",NEGATIVE
Wow! This app is extremely perfect I am wondered by this app features I am wishing Spotify team get more profits!,POSITIVE
Love the music in Spotify!!!,POSITIVE
I just love this bcz Spotify have all the BTS songs that's why I love Spotify,POSITIVE
"Used Spotify for years upon years without the need of any membership. The ads are short, don't come up too often and sometimes have good songs in them so they're not an issue. I'm able to make my own playlists, save as many songs as I like to my liked list and can skip / change songs any time I want until the next ad pops up which is completely reasonable. Used Spotify on PC, Ps4 and Mobile, which all link togther, for the best experience and to get the most out of what it has to offer.",POSITIVE
"The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because adding multiple songs to a playlist is slow and awkward. Aside from that, I love it.",NEGATIVE
This would be a five but every time I make a play list it playes one that I want and then changes my whole Playlist to the worst music ever.. can you just let me listen to my music and not your weird music,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and still free,POSITIVE
Every time I asked for a song it was there!!,NEGATIVE
This app used to play music for me from my playlists or just by simple searching now it plays either adverts or a small sample of my song not the entire thing safe to say unless they update that to change it back I won't be using Spotify again,NEGATIVE
Delivers all our music and podcast requirements,POSITIVE
Ever since i moved to india the app wont let me login at all - and i was on the premium tier. Gone are all my playlists and downloads. Not a good experience and its such a bummer because i spent so much time categorising all of my favorites :(,NEGATIVE
"The update is horrible, it kept playing random songs even tho it's not on my playlist and whenever I pick a song to play it will play a random song before playing the song that I pick usually its just an ad then the song that you pick. For me before the update is more better.",NEGATIVE
Hacked and constant crashes,NEGATIVE
"Now spotify has stopped working completely. In place of fixing the issue, they are increasing the issue. No Internet connection is displayed even with a 200 MBPS stable connection.",NEGATIVE
The app are good but if I play my favorite song it's play's wrong song,NEGATIVE
This app was good at first but then it started giving prblms. I couldnt play songs i like. It started to suffle and show only playlists which i ddnt even ask for. Fix ur app plz,NEGATIVE
This has to be the best app ever made because the sound quality and availability of songs on this app remains unmatchable,POSITIVE
good but i hope they lessen the ads and let us listen in offline without premium,NEGATIVE
Wow is a understatement. Easy to work with. Very good motivational talks. Interactions with my car and other Bluetooth devices is fantastic. Thank you,POSITIVE
Please add voice search option in spotify and add video songs,NEGATIVE
Love it best for music by far,POSITIVE
Best application for listening songs i have ever seen,POSITIVE
Very good music app,POSITIVE
Almost have every songs nd new enhanced feature is gud for finding new songs of ur types,NEGATIVE
Yar everything ok but their are many adds,POSITIVE
I will giving three stars to spotify because it's a amazing app. Clear sound and esy to find songs.,POSITIVE
I enjoy listening to music. This is the best music app to find.,POSITIVE
"I used to love this app, now it makes you pay for basic needs. Spotify is so money hungry you cant skip songs, and it adds other songs when youre trying to listen to a singular song. It adds songs you dont want into a playlist.",NEGATIVE
Constant glitches and playback problems. You can offer me free months til the cows come home. This app is garbage.,NEGATIVE
I can say this the best music app Much love Spotify,POSITIVE
Ads are more frequent,NEGATIVE
I am using a friend's family plan and getting free premium essentially.,NEGATIVE
There is limited skips and you can't play the song you want just shuffle,NEGATIVE
"I absolutely love it, it has everything you can really need when it comes to music. And it 100% deserves a five stars.",POSITIVE
"Really this app is too good, I like it so much. If you want to listen song according to your choice yet, this app is favorable for you. But there are some issues also while using this app.",NEGATIVE
I LOVE this app so much because I love music and I love kpop,POSITIVE
Very nice sound quality is amazing,POSITIVE
W music app if you just get premium. Just get it bro it's goated.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is better than ganna because it's very difficult to find songs in ganna app and spotify is very easy to use and you can find any playlist in it quickly so i suggest you to download only spotify app â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º,POSITIVE
Plz fix the bug. Even after disabling the automix and gapless features still the music is getting automix and is playing gapless Not expected from spotify. Will immediately shift to other apps if the problem is not solved and reverted back. Disgusting bug.,NEGATIVE
"Love spotify (if u pay for it lol) I would suggest adding an option to the sleep timer to stop at ""end of queue"" rather than time",NEGATIVE
Love the playlists I can make and goes with me wherever I go.,POSITIVE
"I love everything about Spotify. Even the free version is amazing. The ability to organize the playlists, favourite songs, and just the overall presentation are perfect.",POSITIVE
"Didn't have any problem with free trial version. Until I subscribed to premium since 2 years ago and the lyrics won't show up in any device idk why. Tried reinstalling, updating, clearing cache for MONTHS. Nothing works..",NEGATIVE
Awesome feature everything is good,POSITIVE
The problem is just when l play my favorite song it choose an random song is so annoying then when l search it it still put random song even l restart like what if u can fix it then fix it!,NEGATIVE
I will try to play my playlist and it will automatically play random different songs that i never even added.,NEGATIVE
I listened to music streaming,POSITIVE
Some songs doesn't show lyrics even though they used to show before.. please fix it,NEGATIVE
"Very good, but I'd love to be able to see a Top 20 All-time most popular for every artist with the total amount of plays.",POSITIVE
Very music playlists make the app...and listen too enjoyed,POSITIVE
"It was a decent application with a lot of advertisement. Less gigabits needed for quick music listening in the background. The premium feature isn't even comparable to YouTubes version, since it is often more expensive for less content and sometimes the advertisement can longer, since you can't skip there and all ads r 30sec.",POSITIVE
"The app is saying all my Playlist are empty and won't let my listen to anything at all? Keeps saying ""try again"" and even after clicking that button it doesn't work.",NEGATIVE
Bring the Settings icon back to the home screen. Why confuse android users with it being hidden in the profile section?,NEGATIVE
"Really nice App, I thoroughly enjoying it, ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"I love it. My music doesn't get put on hold for any ads, it's the best app ever. No regrets.",POSITIVE
Recent updates ruined it. 5 ads for every 3 songs,NEGATIVE
"Its alright I guess. Not bad, but I would prefer YouTube music over Spotify..",NEGATIVE
Every one song 2/3 adds it's irritating,NEGATIVE
I don't know how one of the biggest music companies in the world can't seem to figure out how to make their app work consistently. Your app is garbage. It only works 25% of the time. I can never pick up a podcast where I left off if I'd like to switch to music for a couple hours. Sometimes I can't even get the Podcast or music to PLAY. For a company this big... This apps performance is unacceptable.,NEGATIVE
I love the app but sometimes it like get me another song.,NEGATIVE
I used spend hours in this app but since two days is ca causing so badly that the moment I play any song the app is automatically getting closed.,NEGATIVE
Great selection of all music ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
This app has all my favorite songs and podcast on it,NEGATIVE
What happened now? I can't play my favorite songs in my playlist? How disappointing..,NEGATIVE
Excellent collection. Good quality.,POSITIVE
I Really Love What I Get From Spotify And It Has The Best Music That I Would Tell People To Join Spotify,POSITIVE
As a subscriber I enjoy the wide variety of songs and music available. It's a great service.,POSITIVE
I don't mind the ads that I've grown use to. Like living near an airport; engines get annoying. But listen for the music and cancel out the rest and you'll be alright.,NEGATIVE
It's good but my problem is you can't play the music that you search properly it's like you play a song you press the play button and sometimes it plays a different music and if you play your playlist you can only play it in shuffle you can't play it the way you intended to and it has ads if you really want to use it without the ads you can play music properly etc then get the premium,NEGATIVE
I like new music and the old music and all other music different backgrounds thanks,POSITIVE
I love Spotify playlist and music. I always get can find something to listen to.ðŸ˜ƒ,POSITIVE
Add some more advertisements so we can enjoy your advertisements without playing the songs,NEGATIVE
What the heck happened to 30 minutes of ad free music??? Now we get 2 songs than some ads.... you basically NEED premium to enjoy this app now,NEGATIVE
This srsly keep getting in my nerves mostly if songs different songs are playing wich arent even in my playlist!!,NEGATIVE
"I don't mind the ads appearing too often, but I don't like the automatic selection of the background colors for your own playlists or profile. Sometimes it picks the right color; sometimes it's just plain gray. Perhaps there should be an option to customize our profile and playlist background colors?",NEGATIVE
Terrible. Seems I can only shuffle songs at random and not listen to the playlists I want. I believe this change is new and it was a bad one. If there is some way to turn this off I still think my review would be low because it is not very intuitive.,NEGATIVE
For me the app is a little irratating. Doesnt always show on my playing now. I have to close out and reopen for it fof the app to catch up when i switch from one pod cast to the next.,NEGATIVE
Gud. Why is it soo big for a music player tho?,NEGATIVE
"Wonderful experience, vary easy to operate. Without distraction we can use it. Clarity is good.",POSITIVE
Absolutely recomend its an amazing app but one problem is the ads its alaway that same stupid add about northern kentucky unitversity damn that stupid place,NEGATIVE
the apps becoming unusable the music's always stuttering and I fear years of loyalty will come to an end. I'll switch to Apple music.,NEGATIVE
Great music app thats all i got to say :),POSITIVE
It's the best music app so far.,POSITIVE
"Great music, app sucks. Closes all the time. Makes you start podcast from the beginning. Freezes up often. Super liberal as well, so some things you search for aren't available.",NEGATIVE
Easy listening Easy to find great music,POSITIVE
"Used it a couple times but I don't like the fact you only get limited skips, and you can't choose a song whenever you want. I use YouTube music now and its way better than this app. I would rather watch a 30 second ad then not choose my favorite song. Do you agree or disagree?",NEGATIVE
I can't choose the songs I want to listen to,NEGATIVE
Overall a great app. I don't recommend casting to tv.,POSITIVE
It makes sound sometimes,POSITIVE
Nice selection of music and them stories U share . Thanks for the music it's easier than in 1970' seeking music.,POSITIVE
"Favorite music app, no contest.",NEGATIVE
"Literally will not work at all, nothing plays, playlists give an error apon opening them, asked Spotify about it and still nothing worked, nothing works no matter how hard I try or what I do",NEGATIVE
Spotify is THE BEST!,POSITIVE
"It used to be a 5 star app but, now there are too many adds consecutively. You can listen to 2 songs and then you gotta listen like 4 adds......its disgusting.",NEGATIVE
"At least, let us skip it without limit. Some people are poor and can't afford to pay.",NEGATIVE
"Better than Pandora, but still lacking. Recent updates make it so you can't preview songs before adding to your playlists, which is frustrating. The recommended songs in playlists are now mostly songs that are already on your playlist, super helpful. Hopefully bugs that will be fixed in 6-9 months (sarcasm, but is it?)",NEGATIVE
Love that it is simple to use. Love all the choices. Now I listen to podcasts too. I'm 65 and was nervous about using but I love it!!,POSITIVE
Okay but not great there are limited skips and it also makes Playlists for you and in general its an okay music app would recommend pandora though,POSITIVE
"Pretty cool,but sometimes i ain't able to listen to all the songs",POSITIVE
Best streaming app imo!,POSITIVE
Worst experience with ads! Switching to prime music,NEGATIVE
Very simple and the connection with the car es great,POSITIVE
Lovely choices on music,POSITIVE
This app is outstanding in music,POSITIVE
10/5 professional Spotify dickrider here. I come in my pants every time I open the app.,NEGATIVE
My experience with Spotify is really awesome! The thing I most like about Spotify is the 'daily playlist' that really contains the songs of my choice so i don't have to do constant searching for finding songs of my taste. So for me Spotify is my daily go app for songsðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"It's good but, when i played a song it keeps on changing/shuffling i cant even play my fave song! What if the other doesnt like the other song?! i keep on playing my fave song but it keeps on SHUFFLING like what the, last time when i dowloaded this to my ipad it's not even like that when i played my fave song it's not changing. I know your app is full of music but it's too restrictring, what kind of update is that soptify?! I 'm so disapointed i did everything!",NEGATIVE
You can't fully listen to songs anymore without having to pay,NEGATIVE
Very entertaining and informative. All in one app. Enjoying it ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Too many ads, and that isn't 30 minutes, it's like ten minutes.",NEGATIVE
Great app. Just that so many content creators that are just reviewing content that I am actually looking for. Bothersome.,NEGATIVE
"Please for the love of God, fix the local music player!",POSITIVE
Love the songs and app!,POSITIVE
Never had a issue. Best app for music lovers everywhere,NEGATIVE
"It is to restricting please change it, I tried playing my fav songs but it keeps playing different songs and you even need to get premium? How pathetic, I'm giving this app a 1 star it's to restricting!!ðŸ˜ ðŸ‘Ž",NEGATIVE
Below average on a consistent basis. You shouldn't have to pay for a service that has to be constantly restarted each and every time it's used. The only good thing it has going is it's variety. For an app that had millions of users it's lucky to get a rating at all.,NEGATIVE
Hate the fact that i need premium to get to the songs that i want to get to why cant it be like on pc where i can select any song from my playlist i would apreciate it if you would do the same here,NEGATIVE
"Love that i can find anysong that know if,but wish that there were no ads",NEGATIVE
App is insanely clunky. Keep crashing on podcasts. Pauses for no reason. Just all around annoying to use.,NEGATIVE
I â¤ love Spotify it helps me throughout the day,POSITIVE
"I love this app but I absolutely hate that you have limited skips, and you have to shuffle to play a playlist.",NEGATIVE
Don't get me wrong I do like Spotify but what I really don't like about it is that it adds songs to your Playlist and some of the songs that they put on there are inappropriate songs that I don't want to listen to I hope this gets changedðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜ª,POSITIVE
Love Spotify! I never have any issues! My favorite music platform!,POSITIVE
I love Spotify â¤ï¸ my phone got disconnected and I was lost without it.,NEGATIVE
Excellent service thank you Spotify,POSITIVE
Absolutely useless for uploading your music when it doesn't really track all the accounts because when I put my account name in. It's says their isn't even an account in the first place.,NEGATIVE
"Zero stars really should be an option. Functions most poorly when not connected. Is it a ""streaming"" service? Some paying customers live in areas with low, slow, and unreliable coverage. Unacceptable, for a paid service. Update, still terrible.",NEGATIVE
Keeps pausing randomly when I'm playing music out loud. Every few minutes! Then when I unlock my phone it starts again. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
It's easy to use. An you can lesion to all your favorite bands,NEGATIVE
Have used this app for years very good quality. Could use more new ways to find new music.,NEGATIVE
I have the Spotify app downloaded on my galaxy watch 4. Everytime the screen times out the music pauses. Any ideas on how to fix this?,NEGATIVE
Spotify thank you your #1.,POSITIVE
"I have never taken to this app. I like to own a physical version of my favourite music. Ive gone back to buying Cds. If someone hadn't sold my albums id go straight back to viynal too. Hate ""steaming""",NEGATIVE
Really good quality of music better then SoundCloud,POSITIVE
Play what you want when you want. It's great,POSITIVE
"ads are out of control. Less ads, better app.",NEGATIVE
"I enjoy it. Could use a few more options, like a random shuffle play of everything you've downloaded or maybe just a surprise me Playlist of random stuff. Could be interesting. I'm just happy with no commercials.",POSITIVE
Literally the only music app I can use all other ones confuse me ðŸ’€,NEGATIVE
I like the Spotify app but really you have to get premium to listen to any song you want no I think that's just straight up dumb. So Spotify if you read this review can you please get rid of shuffle play at least make it optional please and I'll upgrade from two stars to four stars. Since you don't want to respond I'm going to give you one star. Fix your app can't you see by the reviews that people don't like it fix your dumb app!! Maybe I might install your app but until then you lost someone.,NEGATIVE
For easy listening the app is great for me ..... a techno illiterate gal !,POSITIVE
This app is very bad because it did not give me the songs that I want and it gives me clips for songs and not full songs for example I was looking for a song and i was not answered I really do not like this app and it does not depend on it at all and there are applications much better than it but I do not want to say its names ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Love the music and how it works ..absolutely favorite,POSITIVE
Spotify is my favorite music player. Been using Spotify for 6-7 years. Its awesome!!!,POSITIVE
"Best streaming platform ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ Edited: after downloading the new update the app is pretty much useless now, can't pick the song you want to listen to, you are basically forced to listen to what they think you like, I'll search a song but I can't play it, it's frustrating. Uninstalled the app already.",NEGATIVE
I pay for premium and can't see joe Roman's podcast. Only works on audio no video.,NEGATIVE
"It has every I could want and more,and Spotify make play list that I might not have thought of. The best place for music love this app",NEGATIVE
Good just less ads please.,POSITIVE
Great app but songs will get stuck and you can't move on from that track no matter what you do to troubleshoot. Spotify is aware of the issue that's been happening for quite some time but no fix in sight.,NEGATIVE
Great service. Ive had other as in Pandora etc. This by far is the BEST.,POSITIVE
Buggy. Never works when I really need it to,NEGATIVE
Nothing seems to be working since I updated the app about an hour ago.,NEGATIVE
If you don't plan on getting premium I recommend skipping. A nightmare just trying to get a song to play without ads or premium push interruptions.,NEGATIVE
App is good but it's constantly cutting out when playing or just stops playing songs altogether and have to reset it every time and it's not cool when using for workout music esp when I pay for premium service I expect it to work,NEGATIVE
"I love this app and I have premium, but the new update came and I can't find lyrics for any song and most of them had lyrics.",NEGATIVE
Basically my paid premium subscription is okay but the shuffle option is a joke and has been for years. Every time the only way to hear different random songs from my 800 plus library is to play songs from the start. No point asking to be fixed cause obviously it's in the too hard basket. Very disappointing.,NEGATIVE
I am so pleased to have Spotify to enjoy my music,POSITIVE
"Lately it's been stalling on songs. One song will play just fine and the next one won't play at all not even if I move the ""timer"" myself. I've had to Uninstall the app a few times hoping that would help.",NEGATIVE
App has continuously gotten worse and have to unistall it frequently to get it to work,NEGATIVE
"New update is causing issues while reproducing music, lag",NEGATIVE
"Constantly glitching on mobile and Mac, been reading about the issues with music stopping at the 9 second mark, I can't believe I'm paying for a faulty app that doesn't work properly, yet they never have issues nor glitches when taking our money.",NEGATIVE
Too many adds and you are very restricted in what you can listen to consecutively on freeplay.,NEGATIVE
"Update: I swear it's like clockwork, every two weeks I have to reinstall because the app breakdown. Does anyone else have this problem? It's ridiculous and I'm getting really sick of it. (Old review) Current Version/Update: is basically unusable. It crashes constantly. I have to open and close it like 5 times before I can get it to even react to my inputs. I'm tired of reinstalling. Worst of all it's making my phone system UI crash too.",NEGATIVE
Spotify constantly disconnects my bluetooth. Will not play songs. Pushs for Bluetooth. Why? Why are you pushing Bluetooth? I'm a hair away from canceling. Still no blocking capability! You're up to no goof like any other platform right now.,NEGATIVE
Love Really easy to use this app,POSITIVE
"The music is great and overall great. But then it starts pausing music, not playing music, and crashing. Can yall please for the love of God fix these issues.",NEGATIVE
Too many useless ads. Also crashes frequently.,NEGATIVE
Always been pushy with ads and their ever increasing costs. Newest update butchered its ability to cast to any of my Google home devices... getting tired of paying more for ever decreasing quality of product.,NEGATIVE
"The app play keeps stopping while playing through, esp when screen shuts off, but very inconsistent all around. Really takes away from a laid back listening experience. ---- Update: last few updates (June 2020) have been doing the same thing again, but even worse. Songs will stop playing seconds after starting, have to scrub through multiple songs to get it audio to start playing again. No control over which you can play when it gets like that. Pause/play is useless",NEGATIVE
"Love the clarity of the music, great selection, but for the love of whichever God you may pray to, can you stop changing the way liked songs works? I personally enjoy the selected genre option, but with it taken away it is much harder to find the songs I want in liked songs. I know Playlist exist, but I find that those are minimizing to what songs I would listen to otherwise. All around, a good app, but inconsistent.",NEGATIVE
"Very bad experience, not working. Ask for login when it wants without any reason. Adds no matters you have the payment version. Too difficult to find one song. Please go to YouTube and enjoy!",NEGATIVE
Love it so easy even for me a 69 yo,POSITIVE
"You all have to fix your app I can't listen to half of the songs I want too, it's always glitching or messing up something is always wrong with it",NEGATIVE
The only thing really bad is the ads there's way to much,NEGATIVE
Spotify meets my needs beautifully. Thank you.,POSITIVE
For some reason won't let me play any of the songs and I pay for premium which means it comes with offline play so it shouldn't be buffering or skipping or pausing or any of that,NEGATIVE
It's a little annoying that I'm paying $10 a month but there are still songs that are blocked,NEGATIVE
"Completely broken for me, can listen to anything",NEGATIVE
Absolutely love my Spotify premium â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"It is absolutely perfect for music, when it works. Lately I have been encountering a lot of glitches like the play bar at the bottom disappearing and the playback slider not working. It forces me to close and restart the app every time. The queue will also occasionally rearrange itself and sometimes makes copies of songs in queue. Once these get fixed, I will change my review.",NEGATIVE
"Used to be really good. Lots of issues and glitches now, it constantly disconnects between my phone and other devices. Wondering if other apps are better for the price ðŸ¤”",NEGATIVE
Used to be the best music streaming service now it shoves podcasts down my throat 24/7 just pay for yt premium or apple music,NEGATIVE
"I really like the app. However, the fact that you have to pay to listen to specific songs just bugs me. My parents won't pay for it, but some of the songs I like, such as Savage and Heart Attack, I have to go through playlists or find the song, put it into one of my playlists, and even then, I might not get to listen to it! So if you could change that, it would absolutely get you a 5 star rating, but until you change that, no way. Edit: Also, I agree with Gryffin Gurl",NEGATIVE
Nice audio quality â¤â¤â¤,POSITIVE
I tried looking up artists that I listen to but it said there were no matches. So I uninstall it then re-install it and now it says that my username is incorrect? I can't log in and spotify is saying I had an issue logging in when I have the smart lock on so it has the correct password.,NEGATIVE
"This app haves good quality music but the problem is when I try to press on a specific playlist it doesn't load, I restalled the app and now it won't search a song I wanna listen to please fix this.",NEGATIVE
Where did the lyrics go? Newest UPDATE thru playstore removed them. WHY???,NEGATIVE
I'm on my last nerve with Spotify I hope Spotify goes to hell ðŸ˜,NEGATIVE
The search bar keeps telling me it can't find songs - it doesn't matter what I type into it.,NEGATIVE
"I liked it, it work with payment and without payment, well obviously is better with paying, butsize is amazing, I recommended",POSITIVE
I've been experiencing a few issues for a few months now which is annoying. Search not working entirely until app cache is cleared and restarted. Also music playing but the player not showing up.,NEGATIVE
"Long things like podcasts literally don't play anymore, no it is not my internet. Fix this now Spotify.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, great music but for the last month or so I haven't been able to listen without it not working when on other apps or having my phone closed and Ive never had this problem before. The reason I originally chose Spotify was bc it works in the background but now it doesnt",NEGATIVE
"Yeah man, it's Spotify",POSITIVE
Feel great to use an app to help my favorite artist.,POSITIVE
if i hear one more suggested song in a playlist i made i swear i will lose my mind. Please stop i just want to listen to my favourite songs but all i hear is songs I don't know and don't like. I'm tired of using all of my skips just to skip the suggested songs,NEGATIVE
"Low res covers with average sound quality... Like what are y'all storing that's so taxing on storage, y'all don't even offer lossless. why?",NEGATIVE
Why did you feel the need to limit skipping songs and not allow to go back without premium,NEGATIVE
It used to be an amazing app with a few adds here and there but now there is more adds than music.,POSITIVE
"Great app all around until recently... Bugs need to be fixed, if people are paying for premium",NEGATIVE
This is so good to download it cause you can play whatever you want a song and you can post it i love it,POSITIVE
I just wanna listen to 1 song. It keeps taking me to Playlist of song that isn't what I search,NEGATIVE
"Even with paying for premium and highest speed internet on EVERY device there's always buffering, pausing, freezing..... Disappointing",NEGATIVE
4 minutes of ads back to back after I paid for the premium. What's up with that?,NEGATIVE
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!,NEGATIVE
This app sucks. I have no control on stopping or starting. Doesn't work with headphones,NEGATIVE
"No ads, just my type of play. The thing I don't like is the shuffle, meaning it play a different music or song you picked. I don't like that.",NEGATIVE
Good app with poor music recommendations,NEGATIVE
This app is great and all but sometimes when I click on a song I want to listen to it gives me a whole other song,POSITIVE
"Refuses to work behind a proxy. The Windows version has settings for proxies, why not the app? Spotify is the buggiest app I've ever seen. It lags on any device to load. It freezes when you change sources. It messes up Windows. 50% of the time, on a dozen new Android devices, it will grey out all downloaded songs when you have no internet. All my cars, all my running watches have no internet and I have music half the time because Spotify's bs programming. Contacted for years, no fix. Worst ever",NEGATIVE
Love listening to all new and old tunes.,POSITIVE
"I listen for free and the advertising compared to other apps is far too frequent and so annoying. I feel like it is a bully tactic to get people to subscribe, which just turns me off.",NEGATIVE
The app is great but for the past few days I haven't been able to listen to my music and I would like to know why,POSITIVE
The ads suck and don't even get me started You get 6 ads for an hour you At least a 100 so it's really hard To use the app I enjoyed it the 1st couple days but then ads started rolling going in and then it it sucked so yeah Just take this advice,NEGATIVE
Gave Adele a touch too much exposure. Nothing technically wrong with that. Julian Alvarez understands. Almost as good as Beppe Grillo basically.,POSITIVE
It wont let me even log in I have to change my country and whenever I click on log in with google it always says theres a problem have another go please fix it let me use the app it never works i wanna make a new account using the same email!!!,NEGATIVE
I don't like how if you want to listen to a sertain song that you can't cuz it is all on shuffle.,NEGATIVE
"Videos in car should be a toggle , if people feel like they can't handle video when connected to car Bluetooth let people chose. So annoying this comes and goes every other update",NEGATIVE
this has to give you more freedom in phones you cant play a specific song and you cant go to the previous song instead on pc you can do all the above also i cant see why would i prefer that from a music app the only difference is that you can play songs instantly instead of having to download them also for this positive thing you there are 2 negatives ads and you have to be connected internet or just pay to have this things,NEGATIVE
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Long time user and moving to another service. Playlists have become so repetitive they're useless. Like 80% of my Spotify-created playlists starts with the exact same song, every single day. And they're made up of about 80% the same songs. Offline downloads don't work half the time, so when I'm on a hike and want to listen to music I have to have a backup app with songs downloaded.",NEGATIVE
Im really happy you can preview songs before you add them to a playlist again!!! like it was 3 stars without but like ahhhhhh yes. makes making playlists and discovering new music a million times easier! (i have premium btw),POSITIVE
I love Spotify! Especially for my get togethers. I make a Playlist and just let it run! I also use it for my podcast Lifeofy. My mother uses it as well and my kids for workouts and parties!!! Love how you can que songs so everyone can hear something they want!,POSITIVE
The app continues to freeze and then stop working even after an update. Please limit the amount of ads they get annoying and time consuming.,NEGATIVE
Quite buggy and loads of ads,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify on every platform.,POSITIVE
"Hi, I love this app. I have it on my phone and tablet, but there's differences between them. Firstly, on my tablet, I can chose any song I want to play. On the other hand, my phone doesn't let me play a specific song, and when I'm playing my playlist, some random songs just play. Please fix this stuff that happens for free version. Not everyone wants to pay for the subscription, like me. Just make it equal because I just want to play music I like and don't get the chance because of this.",NEGATIVE
"Only reason to download this app is the Joe Rogan Experience. Every time I use the app on my phone it crashes at least once. I have a brand new phone and this is the second phone it crashes on. It crashes so often my new phone even tells me the app ""frequently crashes should be put into deep sleep"". The app for TV does not play video........ why?",NEGATIVE
Awesome flawless collection of music genres,POSITIVE
My Constant Music App I use this every day for my Taxi job all the time.,NEGATIVE
"Awesome, Easy to use, just takes awhile to build your playlist again. Wish it had a shuffle feature(or I just haven't found it yet)",NEGATIVE
Expensive! Not even competitive Â£10 / month,NEGATIVE
Good app easy to use 1 issue recently music streaming was stopping after 30 seconds and not starting again for at least a minute. Seems to be working fine again now.,POSITIVE
Great service! And a pretty crisp design,POSITIVE
"It's super reliable and many choices for listening throughout. Although, the have taken down many epic and amazing JRE podcasts and for that alone, they suck. Otherwise pretty great.",POSITIVE
Favorite music at ur fingertips...instantly. I love it!!!,POSITIVE
What's up with all the bugs? Music stops because of in app notifications. Most of the time the lock screen controls don't appear. Frustrating,NEGATIVE
It's very easy to listen to music ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
Thank you for bringing back the song previews. I can efficiently make my playlists again ðŸ¤—,POSITIVE
can't preview songs while adding to playlists anymore.,NEGATIVE
"It's pretty good , but to get a 5 star a lot of work needs to be done.",NEGATIVE
"Too many ads , and what's with the lyrics . It's all messed up . You watch an Ad for 30 secs and you get free 30 mins except ads goes for 1 min and after 3 songs another ad pops up. Y'all be drivin it too much for the money .",NEGATIVE
Enjoyable and professional,POSITIVE
"The amount of advertising has exploded. This is a great app if you want to listen to two songs, followed by three ads. I am looking for another option, because Spotify has definitely declined recently.",NEGATIVE
Playing random songs that arent in my playlist even though i have 23 songs in it-,NEGATIVE
"Awsome app,great sound quality,huge catalogue",POSITIVE
Plays ads after app is closed and you need to force stop it. So many ads.,NEGATIVE
"For my liked songs, it doesn't let me scroll through the different categories/genres.",NEGATIVE
Spotify the best in music and where you recover your soul,POSITIVE
"Best app for song,music and podcast I",POSITIVE
just because of the ads,NEGATIVE
Excellent experience but the ads are a lot if not considering premium.,POSITIVE
only problem is using phone as a remote is insanely laggy I DONT TO LISTEN YEAT BUT I CANT SKIP,NEGATIVE
With this app am a very happy person because am learning through song messages,POSITIVE
I tried listening to one specific song but instead get random stuff it was so annoying and this happens for a lot of stuff,NEGATIVE
Spotify - outstanding app for simplicity and non-stop Gospel Song or Music.,POSITIVE
Not good app can't skip songs,NEGATIVE
I would like to have the option to repeat a song as many times I want.,NEGATIVE
"I love it beos there are international songs koren,English 5 â­",POSITIVE
Great content terrible app. Gets stuck playing but says it's not playing so you cannot pause or play. Only way is to completely reset the app by closing it out. This happens nearly every time. Samsung S20.,NEGATIVE
Sometimes the system can't handle me playing to much music and if I swipe app and come back on to try play the same song it just simply won't play! Else I do prefer it over apple music !,NEGATIVE
Such a great music app and preferably my favorite!,POSITIVE
app is good but I agree with the reviews ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’« but cmon let us chose whatever song we want but with ads I prefer to listen to my music in order but atleast with ads instead of paying to chose what song I want to listen to ad freeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
"Been a premium user for years and have spent thousands of hours listening to music. It's one of my favorite apps and ways to listen to music after being spammed by ads from Pandora a few year years ago. Plus, I really enjoy the fact they now include lyrics.",POSITIVE
"This App is good, It has some glitches sometimes that needs to be fixed. Pretty handy overall.",POSITIVE
The best music app.,POSITIVE
Awesome very user friendly ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
I think it comes down to preference but I enjoy using Spotify more than other music platforms and do recommend at least trying spotify.,POSITIVE
Honestly great app but I hate it just adds songs by itself,POSITIVE
Best app in the market. Literally everyone uses it. Very user friendly interface. Even the premium version is worth it.,POSITIVE
So good app nice sound qualityðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
"Broken app now. Don't know what happened but I no matter what I do, I can't play music, nothing loads or is even clickable anymore. Uninstall, update, nothing. Windows still still fine but the app is useless.. So I'm basically paying to look at names of albums I've heard recently and that's about it. I can't even search for music. Also disabling account is pretty confusing so I'm gonna get charged for something I can't use now.",NEGATIVE
"It's a 100% perfect music app , but fix the bugs in searching for songs.",NEGATIVE
"4* due to ads, otherwise it is 5*",NEGATIVE
Best music experience.,POSITIVE
"This app is honestly super dope but after every second y'all juss be wanting us to pay premiums and shii whilst fuel cost R25 a litre...like seriously tho!(. Y'all gotta understand WE ARE BROKE GUYS...so please nehh, please!!",NEGATIVE
i love it i listin to music everywhere even ask you what type of songs you want,POSITIVE
Too much advertisements.,NEGATIVE
"Actually this app was really great but it's new update disappoints me, I can't play my favorite songs and it's too restricting. This app makes me infuriated! ðŸ˜¤ And I'm gonna uninstall this right now!",NEGATIVE
This app sucks big time. I got the premium and it was still loaded with ads and commercials. Its not user friendly. Honestly spotify should take their lessons from youtube,NEGATIVE
The songs on playlist dont bring a list of songs,NEGATIVE
"Welcome to the new era of music listening experience. The premium membership is totally worth it. I have my family included in the membership because you are able to send up to five invitations for any of your fams that want to listen to music. You are able to share each other's listening history and share each other's perspective for the Love of music. As an eclectic human being, I desire many different options, and the daily mixes that are automated for me absolutely perfectly mixed. Thank you",POSITIVE
"The app itself is great, works fine, but I don't appreciate if the premium charge bounces, when you reprocess the payment and it automatically upgrades you from premium to the next more expensive plan (like single person to two) and you cannot access billing through the app. You have to access billing through the website only.",NEGATIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
Fed with adds they come like 3 or 4 times in a row,NEGATIVE
Best app execpt the advertisements.. Everything is good,POSITIVE
It's not a bad app although the fact that you can not choose the song you wish to listen to kinda sucks. I don't really skip nor mind the ads but I want to be able to choose what I listen to not the have it on shuffle.,POSITIVE
I pay 11.99 a month and still can't play my downloaded music offline. I can't get ahold of anyone from Spotify to help me with this problem and can't seem to find where to take my credit card off my account. This has been happening since I transfer my stuff over from my last phone. Very unsatisfied with this service!!!,NEGATIVE
itd be perfect if i didnt have to pay for premium to have my music downloaded.,POSITIVE
Love this app but too much ads,NEGATIVE
"your app just scammed me of R60, please see to the issue like i subscribed, i have the bank notification the app worked for a day i could download music but now why do I have to update my payment for a third time i was supposed to get a free month but y'all still took money now y'all want a third subscription in the space of one week? nah g, fix my issue or gimme a refund",NEGATIVE
This good but never dawnload song ðŸ¤¦,POSITIVE
"I only use this app for podcasts. Otherwise, it's useless. It never sticks to the albums I select and often plays songs that aren't my playlists. And I hate that the desktop version only plays two songs between ads. I'm better off listening to music on YouTube. At least those ad breaks are short and skippable.",NEGATIVE
It's annoying how I have to be online to be able to select my downloaded music from the latest update.,NEGATIVE
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version.",NEGATIVE
"So um idk why but my phone doesn't have the play pause button at the bottom anymore and I really don't like it. Also I Can't open the song I am listening to or see it's lyrics. It also is slow when it's loading the song I searched. I really would appreciate it if you fix all these issues I have stated and also everyone else's issue please . ( try to go threw comments ) Other than that, the app is extremely cool.",NEGATIVE
Hifi Lossless quality audio streaming has to come,NEGATIVE
Great! I love seeing the lyrics and the recommend selections are SPOT on ðŸ˜‰,POSITIVE
"*an alright app, especially when not using premium but some issues I just don't dig;; 1. unavailability to save queue as a playlist 2. shuffle doesn't work unless you skip the song,, is when it finally shuffles 3. search should have a filter when it comes to searching for playlists (I'm new to using this app, bare with me) to have an ascending-descending option n vice versa, when it comes to likes and playtime",NEGATIVE
"The free version is not ad free, but the ads are not annoyingly frequent. Also, I know everyone worries about ""big brother,"" but I like that the ads are relevant to me. Also, there is no real competition for what they provide...",POSITIVE
This is the only app I use for music & podcasts!!!,NEGATIVE
"App is Good, i just didn't liked it's widget. I would love if developers improve its widget's interface/layout, bcoz it looks so simple",POSITIVE
App won't work for me at all. I can't play any music and I have premium! It also says all playlists are empty. The app used to work perfectly for me now I can't get it to work on this device at all.,NEGATIVE
I dont have a radio in my truck so I use this on my phone.,NEGATIVE
Best musice platform on the planet ðŸŒ âœŒï¸,POSITIVE
Horrible app performance after latest update,NEGATIVE
Nice app but please remove the ads without premium,NEGATIVE
"I'm having some slight glitches with the album covers showing. I have excellent reception, so that's not the problem.",POSITIVE
This is very useful very simple app and good,POSITIVE
Please add option for list of songs singer wise. Its very difficult to browse songs of our favorite singer's or artists,NEGATIVE
Why I have a s22 ultra latest update why does ðŸ’© not work right this is going on like 6 months,NEGATIVE
"I like the app but its frustrating sometimes, for example: I can't play just one song, it always shuffles to a different song even though I went to play a single, I can't seem to find my account details which restricts me from seeing what email I'm using, and lastly, it always on shuffle even though I didn't put it on shuffle.",NEGATIVE
"I listen music while gaming too,it's fun listening music in Spotify",POSITIVE
This music and selection is totally awesome!!,POSITIVE
The best ever streaming platform,POSITIVE
App that I use every single day. Great way to explore and enjoy the music.,POSITIVE
"I'm still fine with the app for the most parts, I especially love the large selection of podcasts! HOWEVER why on earth does it stop playing whenever I open Instagram and there is a MUTED video on my timline!! watching muted reels and stories is fine, but beware if there's some random video in your feed lol",NEGATIVE
Premium Member for 6 years now; before and I've haven't had to buy an album again. Everything is fresh and theres always something new.,POSITIVE
"Tis good, I prefer some older features for the desktop version tho",POSITIVE
Very nice app. I just listen to my choice of music and i ðŸ˜‰,POSITIVE
"Good selection but has playback issues, regularly cuts out for a few seconds for no reason at all",NEGATIVE
Car mode is annoying!! Im sick of having to choose. Stop car mode please.,NEGATIVE
A very good app but there are some songs missing and so many ads we used to face while listening to the music I know ads are important for your business but too many ads are not good show people limited ads after 15 or 20 mins u can run ads but not after every song change,NEGATIVE
Occasional bugs. I have been a prime music user and now I really feel like I have upgraded even though I have just switched to a free service from a paid service.,POSITIVE
Used to be five stars. That was before the music that I'm listening to would skip or pause completely. After the recent update the music have been playing weirdly. Hopefully spotify sees this and corrects the app so the music will stop skipping/pausing while playing. Spotify needs to hurry up and fix this song skipping issue,NEGATIVE
Awful i hear more ads and less songs,NEGATIVE
"Turn it on and let it go, no talk, no ads!",NEGATIVE
"I would give no stars but I need to review Do not get the premium it's awesome that you get better sound quality and unlimited skips but if you want to cancel keep doing it because they will continue to charge you ""because that's how the system works"" is what I was told by customer support I urge you not to use this service",NEGATIVE
This best music player i never used before. Thank you so much created this player. I listen to music in this player.,POSITIVE
It's a wonderful app but they need data to save your music playlist,NEGATIVE
"Eyerthing is fine about this app except add timings,after 5 min interval add starts to play more than I used to hear songs",POSITIVE
Full of ads,NEGATIVE
"Its an amazing app, the only thing I would change is the fact that you only have 6 skips, i get that its a premium feacher but it gets anoying, besides that I love this app!!!",POSITIVE
It used to be a five star but they made it so that on spotify free you can't listen to a playlist with shuffle off it's crazy .,POSITIVE
I don't like ads in between music,NEGATIVE
Best application for Anime songs!,POSITIVE
Too many adds,NEGATIVE
Worth the price to go Premium!,POSITIVE

Ummm but this app is good I love it and for high quality music so I listen songs during tuotion ummmmmm during school also!,POSITIVE
My experience Spotify is most amezing app for the music ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
All my downloaded songs are gone somehow. Now Im unable to play offline. Worst experience ever.,NEGATIVE
"Bring back the feature where, when I select podcasts in my library, each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated. Knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information, most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days. Please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason. Still buggy, every time they patch something, something else starts acting weird. Again having premium makes no difference.",NEGATIVE
"Awesome, THE BEST Music App of this generation!!!",POSITIVE
I wish I could somehow see what songs I've heard before. I'm going through a 69 hour playlist and it's hard to keep track of my place in the playlist and on random setting I'll never know if I heard all the songs. Or sometimes I don't remember if I've heard a playlist or album before or just parts of it.,NEGATIVE
I like the way I can find songs easily and tons of songs to chose from,POSITIVE
Still a very good app. The earliest versions of the app were superior (0.7) but I find I can do everything I want with this app. Great compatibility with corresponding apps for Spotify connect on a number of platforms.,POSITIVE
Toatlly full of ads Irritated,NEGATIVE
The app works great I was using iHeartRadio iHeartRadio and in front of my introduced me to spotify I use spotify now when I don't use iHeartRadio.,POSITIVE
"I have Spotify premium and it has been a great experience until now. The app has begun to switch to the next song when Im only half through with the first one, skipping it on its own. It also will pause on its own and not play the next song. I thought it was a wifi problem, but these are downloaded songs. It used to let me play downloaded songs when out pf wifi range but it will no longer play them, making the download feature pointless",NEGATIVE
Control player disappears. Please allow for multiple selections of titles. Samsung Fold 3,NEGATIVE
"The coustmer service is the best...they reply the mails quickly and it takes maximum 2 days for them to fix any problem within the app ....well it was 2 days for me. I enjoy the premium, and to be true i loved that they have premium for University students, and it's very cheap.",NEGATIVE
I loved this app I can listen to every song I want to listen and they even have very nice playlist ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,POSITIVE
"No words for this app use and rate it I am future teller so you will not left this app . So welcome to your permanent addective and super easy to use , app. We all are Spotify family.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify I can select what music I want when I want!!,POSITIVE
The only problem about this app is the add but still it is a very great app to listen to music,POSITIVE
There are lots of pirated songs on this app .,NEGATIVE
"4 star. I love spotify and I wouldnt trade it for any other app. Things that need attention: I found that if I have a playlist or something on shuffle, not all of the songs play before repeating songs I have already heard.",NEGATIVE
"ads, Ads,ADs,ADS,AND MORE ADS then when you think they stopped AD RIGHT THERE",NEGATIVE
The app really good I can hear all of my favourite songs,POSITIVE
Best music app ever also highly recommend premium if you can't afford it get duos and spit it with a friend,POSITIVE
Useless app literally. I tried playing the song I want but it only plays the suggested song. I don't recommend this appðŸ˜‘,NEGATIVE
"It's pretty good, although it does change music on you sometimes. For example, I'd be listening to a playlist of 8 Graves, and then it'd play TeZatalks out of nowhere. Other than that, it's fine.",POSITIVE
Excellent this app was really good specially i also really like kpp sonfs so it is best for me saranghe spotify(love spotify),POSITIVE
Love this app I can listen to all the music,POSITIVE

Super app but reduce ads,NEGATIVE
I really love this music app...alot,POSITIVE
Can use it in background and easy to use,POSITIVE
I use it 6 days as week 14 hours a day this is the absolute best app hands down,POSITIVE
"Pays poorly compared to other services. Also decides to mess up when there's no internet connection, so that's fun. After all this, they increased prices in a sly way by only warning of your current subscription going up, not others. And now the app is going all wonky. If you're increasing prices, increase the quality, not lower it. Tried moving songs to SD card, had to force shut app then reinstall it.",NEGATIVE
Love the app so far. Very good selections of music for all taste.,POSITIVE
"If you're always making changes, and improving, then tell us what you changed and improved. The 10,000 song limit is stupid ridiculous. Also, minus 1 more star for never telling us specifically what changes and improvements have been made. Can you at least link to a blog or something?",NEGATIVE
Having an awesome time using Spotify,POSITIVE
Not able to Login my Account On Spotify App . ðŸ¥² Please help,NEGATIVE
"Every time i open a new instance of the app to listen to a podcast i previously started, spotify junps to the next commercial spot, ussually at the end of the episode, and i lose my spot in the playback. Been happening for months.",NEGATIVE
Great!! Offline option is awesome,POSITIVE
Should be able to listen to the song you want with out going through so much trouble,POSITIVE
Best app for music frrr,POSITIVE
"App will not connect to internet. Can access the app and log in, but can not play music. ""Something went wrong"" cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled, reinstalled. Nothing.",NEGATIVE
Opened this all first time in 3 years 5 ads back to back. I suggest another app,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever !,POSITIVE
"Premium feature So I've been a Spotify user for a while now, maybe 2 or 3 years now, and decided to use premium. Highlighting the pros and cons I've come across using Spotify Premium. Pros: unlimited skips, ad free, and shuffle feature. Cons: Spotify will shuffle the music order instead in the order you choose (not sure if that's a bug), songs will randomly start playing from other playlists and the music will suddenly stop playing for no reason. So hopefully these cons get fixed.",NEGATIVE
"Too much ads , its ok to show ads but it's too much.",NEGATIVE
I love this app i can easyly find any song even if i am on other acc by serching ur user you can play ur playlist,POSITIVE
"Rating it as one, because I don't think they want any user experience here. I mean I understand one ad is okay, but back to back 3 ads in one go. Pathetic.",NEGATIVE
Great sound. Easy to use.,POSITIVE
Great choice and variety,POSITIVE
a great app for music and podcasts,POSITIVE
Variety of playlist available based on your mood & fav artist. Reasonable price for student subscriptions.,NEGATIVE
was great till all my playlists decided to just be available to preview only.,NEGATIVE
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs and let's me make my own playlist.,NEGATIVE
"Everytime i enter my email it becomes red and doesn't allow me to continue. Please fix it, Spotify...",NEGATIVE
Not working properly on samsung watch 4 lte,NEGATIVE
I have been using this app since last 2 years. This is a great app for listening online and offline music. Also the charge for subscription is low. Totally my experience was good with this one song app..thanks team Spotify..,POSITIVE
Please fix the mobile network download bug... Data ain't cheap. Still 5 Star though,NEGATIVE
Absolutely worst app ever. If you don't have premium like this time around i couldn't take the premium. This app will show ads right after one song or sometimes in the middle that too 2 ads 30secs each continuously. This is too much now. Can't tolerate this nonsense anymore. Better to switch to some other music app.,NEGATIVE
I am enjoying listening to music which I have chosen,POSITIVE
The audio and lyrics are amazing but I just don't understand why I can't listen to a specific song and when I make a Playlist with less than 15 songs it's automatically adds songs by itself and I can't even skip properly Also my ad experience is below zero,NEGATIVE
I used to love Spotify but the aggressive way it's trying to force podcasts on me and the horrendous way it makes other other artists pretend to be more well known names is bloody frustrating.,NEGATIVE
"Now I've never heard music before and then someone told me to get this. I was like ""yeah right!"" First off, ""music"" can't be all that great, otherwise I would have heard it already. Second of all, how can an app have what it claims, which is music to listen to?? Well let me tell you folks! I was wrong!! Not only is music very very good and interesting, but this app has it! You can listen to it on headphone, or the phone or the computer and other ways! You gotta try this!",POSITIVE
"Long time premium member. Spotify is part of my daily to and from work. There was a problem before with it shutting down when I was using my phone on other apps, the web etc. It seemed it was fixed and as of this morning seems it's back again. As a premium member I would hope this is addressed quickly so I can give it a better rating.",NEGATIVE
Loding and ads issues always,NEGATIVE
"The only preferred app for high quality music , the best genres , the best music combos and many more!",NEGATIVE
Nice music updates but only if you put the option for downloading mp3,NEGATIVE
Nice app to listen a music,POSITIVE
best streaming music app,POSITIVE
"It keeps giving me suggested songs when I turned the option off, can't listen to a certain song it gives you a random song by them or similar if you have a pc get the pc version please.",NEGATIVE
My go-to music no matter the mood I'm in. I can always find a good variety of songs from all genres!!!,POSITIVE
pretty good. I just would like if you stop the ads.,POSITIVE
Its too much good for audio,NEGATIVE
Spotify is good for tablet and laptop but it sucks on mobile. You cant select a single song but you have to play the entire playlist to get to your one song. Making it annoying when you just want to hear one song. Id rather use Youtube for music on my phone than spotify. They have to do something about because it really sucks a ton. I dont recommend it on the phone at all but on tablet and laptop/computer then sure.,NEGATIVE
Great way to listen to all your favourite music. Whenever I drive I listen via Android Auto.,POSITIVE
"it's a good app runs smooth simple ui and I've always used the solo premium plan but recently I did the family plan with 6 profiles and it was fine for a month or so but after that it changed my plan to the solo premium again, charged me 10 instead of 16 and canceled premium on my family's devices when I didn't change anything so that was my 1st bad experience with spotify",NEGATIVE
I like Spotify Ive used it for 5 years and not once has it let me down,POSITIVE
Great music selection,POSITIVE
"So basically everything is ok? But umm I really have to say that whenever I just want to play a song even I click the name but the other song pop out uhhh I'm hoping they can fix this. Because it's really to listen to a song sometimes. And even u got playlist u can't play that song it have to be followed by number. The system it self keep adding other song that I definitely didn't add, that's really disturbing",NEGATIVE
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.,POSITIVE
Only give 3 stars caz. of adds caz they says 30 min of uninterrupted music and adds comes after every music,NEGATIVE
"Still the best one so far. The bad thing is that when you install, could suggest better music from Brazil, like classic MPB (Vinicius, Tom, Toqunho, Miucha, Chico, etc).",NEGATIVE
I want to block all podcasts from my Spotify home for good. Please give us a new subscription tier that will automatically block all podcasts. Thank you.,NEGATIVE
Spotify Is Good But Please Just Give Free Spotify Users An Advantage,POSITIVE
This app is goodðŸ’œther are all song thare bts blackpink song tooðŸ¦‹ðŸ’œlove is app ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
just plays music and podcasts it good can connect to crome casts laptops and playstation don't know about Xbox I don't have one I was playing music and got 6 ads with out 30 minuets of ads a disgrace,NEGATIVE
Let me tell you people I know the ads suck but if it shows you a ad just take off the app and boom no ads,NEGATIVE
"Only the Ads is the only thing which is really really terrible, horrible whatever the word ypu use here, but it's true. The Premium subscription for this also seems bit expensive for an Individual.... Should have been little less expensive and much more affordable in price, So that those who loves to listen music from Spotify, don't have to find an alternative for this one. I hope they note the point, once again!! ðŸ˜ŒðŸ™ðŸ»",NEGATIVE
Can't play songs before adding them to my playlist.,NEGATIVE
The app has been quite easy to use. So far I have had no issues with it.,POSITIVE
"Cool I love listening to music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ it's a cool app I don't have that much problems so it's a great appðŸ‘ðŸ˜ the problem is that it needs internet so yeah,it needs internet to work but that doesn't bother me that much so it's a great appðŸ‘ðŸ˜â¤ï¸",POSITIVE
This app makes finding the music that suits you easy. It can also pair with several devices enabling you access to the convenience that it provides. This app truly is a masterpiece and I encourage the developer's to keep adding more cutting edge software into the interfaces and security aspects.,POSITIVE
This app is so amazing you can choose Song Download now,POSITIVE
Super Duper....sucks a little in the free option.,NEGATIVE
"Enjoy the next 30 minutes free from advertising.. song..ad.ad.ad.ad.song.ad.ad.song.song.ad..... I was a pior premium user, but due to excessive bugs and podcast issues have chosen to discontinue paying for a premium account and will probably find a alternative service.",NEGATIVE
Its a good music app.,POSITIVE
Great selections of music,POSITIVE
When you using Google Chrome on your phone Spotify will sometimes just cut off completely then restart the song your listening to and will happen multiple times in a row please fix,NEGATIVE
Excellent love Spotify,POSITIVE
"Very nice music app with almost all music I know on it. Easy to make playlists and share music. Only too bad you cannot orden your playlists very efficiently. I listen to a lot of different genres and I have about 30+ playlists, which I cannot arrange top to bottom. Also showing your account to other spotify users, or accessing others accounts is a bit confusing but not entirely impossible, however, anyone who visits your account will initially only see your last 3 playlists. no clue why........",NEGATIVE
Great. I found all my favorites from when I was growing up.,POSITIVE
Struggle to connect with amazon echo auto,NEGATIVE
Nice app! But many songs are not present here!,NEGATIVE
"Question: I got a free version with ads. The ad will play for 30 seconds and Spotify will announce that next 30 mins are ad free. So my question is what does ad free and 30.mins means? Because the ads will continue after the announcement and once that's over, more ads will start after around 15 mins. Don't know if to trust the paid version. The music is very limited. 6 months and you are done with Hindi music",NEGATIVE
4/23/22 Will change rating when the song preview feature when adding songs to a playlist has been returned,NEGATIVE
"These updates have screwed with my experience.....offline mode is no longer available the moment you put it on and stays that way until you reset and I have to redownload everything again. This becomes annoying(an under statement) but seriously do something about this, and yes I have premium(Samsung A70)",NEGATIVE
"I think Spotify is one of the best music services in the world. The song collection is incredible. But other music services have better audio quality than Spotify. So Spotify should add next-gen audio technologies like spatial audio. But overall, it's a great app for music .",POSITIVE
"This is my best music app i use everyday, but the ad is so f**kin anoying.",NEGATIVE
It's all good now ðŸ˜‡ .lyrics are there ðŸ˜‡ .thanks for always improving the app ðŸ˜‡,POSITIVE
"Sometimes it makes me think this is the worst UI with buggy music app, I've been a premium member for almost an year still this thing won't load interface or songs properly most of the times",NEGATIVE
Very nice music app ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Its a headache There are too many ads and it will make you uncomfortable when you in a way of your own life of music ðŸ¤¬,NEGATIVE
"Lower your ad volume, it's louder than the music... almost destroyed my 460$ headphones",NEGATIVE

Great. Im using this app for five years and always great,POSITIVE
this app is good but they're too many ad:-\,NEGATIVE
"No matter what mood your in, you can find the perfect song on Spotify.",POSITIVE
"Recommend new and old songs daily so that people can vibe. Your company is only running because of the API and podcasts. But Spotify as a music app still needs a push ... Speaking facts ""Resso"" Is better as Music app",NEGATIVE
Just want to say thank you to the Spotify team for assisting me . I had my account hacked and found out I had 6 users subscribed to my account details . After contacting them they assisted me with the process and I have received my refunds and those accounts have been blocked . Very impressed with there service ! Well done team !,POSITIVE
"I was amazing with this app. It provides everything song, podcasts and much more that I wanted",POSITIVE
Best quality of music compared to any other music apps plus the clutstering technique of the fav playlists is top notch,POSITIVE
Music Streaming just got better.,POSITIVE
Enjoying everything most especially OLDTIME FAVORITES !,POSITIVE
They disallow local (offline) storage if you not a paid user BUT they still use your phone to store ALL the songs in order to save their server data use. They WILL try to funnel you into music you don't want. If you good at structuring your music selection so to not even need skipping songs they will FORCE you out of it by LITERALLY refusing to play it after a while and instead pay random songs not in your list EVEN TOUGHT you disable the related future. The app is NOT being improved either,NEGATIVE
So much ti choose from with podcasts abd music. Love it!,POSITIVE
Playing any other song but app play other song ðŸ˜ˆ,NEGATIVE
Love it ðŸ˜€ wayyyy better than pandora or any other music streaming services by a long shot. I haven't had any negative experiences other than when I started my spotifiy premium trial and it didn't let me listen without internet :/ overall the best streaming service on the app store. I 100% would recommend and would even argue in favor to this application.,POSITIVE
"Can't even play my song, desktop version is 999999x better",NEGATIVE
Whenever too my mind to listened so I'm listening my favourite song in Spotify that is too awesome app for songs like hindi Korean Chinese so i like it Spotify,POSITIVE
THIS IS A MUST HAPP ON YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER OR ANY DEVISE YOU HAVE WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY. Althoughit would be a ten star if it would stop playing other random songs that you didn't put up on a playlist,NEGATIVE
"I've had issues with it in the past but recently it started playing three commercials for every one song. I contacted customer support to see if it was some sort of error and no one even looked into it, the just suggested I try a free month of Spotify Premium to see if I'd prefer it with no commercials. I'd prefer an app that wasn't 3/1 commercials over content.",NEGATIVE

"I've used Spotify for many years now, and I love it! I've had premium for a while, and I just went up to duo actually. It's going really well. There's only 1 suggestion I could make, and that's to please add in a feature that allows people to sort playlists into different groups that way I can see different groups of playlists and choose instead of all 36 of them at once. But it's a very good app!",POSITIVE
"It's a great app and all, the music is good and you find what you want but the annoying thing is that when you search for a song you want to play and select it, it starts playing other songs that you did not even want to listen to and you have to wait for all thoooseeee songs to play, it's very annoying.... Please fix this, plus when you make a playlist it starts playing other songs that aren't in your playlist.... Please fix these issues, the are not making it user friendly enough",NEGATIVE

This app isn't bad at all its just when you want to play a song or something it shuffles it and you have to use all of your skips in order to play the specific song,NEGATIVE
Decent on terms of info about artist but why can't I have an option to view all of an artist's music in a list? Every other music streaming app I have allows this but for Spotify your choice is either viewing albums or a small list of top songs.,NEGATIVE

"What's up with crashes when viewing video podcast? Other than that, audio features and plagbacks are top notch",NEGATIVE

very greedy. can't we just skip ads? and why do we have to play a music in shuffle if you don't have premium,NEGATIVE
"Bugs for months! The app is close to unusable. Unacceptable, especially for Spotify premium A podcast started playing midway through a phone call. Controls for 'currently playing' not coming up in the app. Including no sign that Spotify is playing at all. Let alone outside of it on the screen or drop down menu. Randomly stops playing music. This is a previous bug that has also been occuring in recent updates.",NEGATIVE
"3 ads always, every 3 songs. this is too many ads and im not paying for Premium out of spite",NEGATIVE
"I paid and you switched my plan to individual and deleted my family's accounts. I can't even contact anyone to cancel this payment and fix it. We've had our family account for years. This is VERY unprofessional. I'm beyond livid. Update: I contacted support and there is nothing they can do. Years of our music is gone, they lied about what they were going to charge me, and changed it AFTER I hit submit, and they can't fix it. Be weary before you buy.",NEGATIVE

I love Spotify because it helps with my stress and when am sad,POSITIVE
"I wish there was a viable alternative for android. SO MANY BUGS THEY NEVER FIX. My friend sent a link to a song just now, took 12 tries of opening it to get spotify to actually go to the song.",NEGATIVE
This app just stops working suddenly even if you have updated and with a good internet connection.I would say even jungle has less bugs then their server....,NEGATIVE

Finally I can enjoy Spotify in Botswana. I'm loving it so so much. The endless music and of course the podcasts. Never a dull moment with Spotify.,POSITIVE
"Premium subscriber for many years, and I'm troubled by the increasing instability and new bugs. What worked perfectly for years now fails constantly even on completely different devices. For example, player control will disappear leaving you unable to control playback, then requiring you to force stop app, restart to restore control. And suggested music is far inferior to Pandora's genome. Seems that Spotify favors music that favors their own preferences than yours.",NEGATIVE
I am not good with words but I will say this is a great app. would recommend,POSITIVE
Will stay the best music app forever!,POSITIVE
It is super easy to use Spotify I love it!!,POSITIVE
Learning so much and having fun in the process being inspired being in tune with so much art,POSITIVE

I like Spotify better than any of the others.,POSITIVE
It literally shuffles songs when I don't want it to and I can't even listen to the songs I want anymore And you can't even skip the ads and when I tap on the song I want it just shows a preview instead,NEGATIVE
"GARBAGE! wouldn't play a single thing for longer than 2 seconds before the whole thing just went away. No ""stopped working"" notification or anything, just POOF. web player audio is all weird, gets loud for a second then quite. Whatta waste of time.",NEGATIVE
This is getting worse and worse. 6 ads before you play music is ridiculous.,NEGATIVE
I'm a dj and like the music updates and jamming to my Playlist in the car,POSITIVE
It's almost perfect! I wish the play next button has crossfade mixing effect too. I'd love that feature.,POSITIVE
Monthly update breaks the podcast player but doesn't allow you to to stop the podcast. The ie the dashboard for the podcast doesn't appear at the bottom. Happening again just a month later after another update. And again this app is getting worse for Samsung users.... Right on que one month later,NEGATIVE
Very good app nice music I like it too much nice,POSITIVE
It's a really good app I found songs I forgot about,POSITIVE
It was good first until YOU guys updated it. At first I was able to pick any song I wanted but NOW I have to use all my skips to get the song that I want (if the song is far then... You're not getting there) also there are too many ads I can't listen to a song/podcast without an ad popping up. I will be updating it back to 5 stars if you fix your stuff and make this app useful again.,NEGATIVE
"The music is good and reliable, I can at least rely on spotify. Thank you DJ Ken",POSITIVE
Bestest music app to ever exist.,POSITIVE
Reference of songs is not complete,NEGATIVE
Very user friendly and has all good collection of music.,POSITIVE
Whats up with all the skipping songs? There's a lot of needing to close the app then reopen because its skipping too much,NEGATIVE
So good and enjoying to hear music,POSITIVE
7 ads and 3 of them being 30 seconds....,NEGATIVE
No way to clear the queue except when playing specific playlists; extremely annoying. Also can't clear queue/now playing if only one song is queued.,NEGATIVE
Annoying and inconsistent in its operation.,NEGATIVE
For kannada songs lyrics should be in kannada..it can be useful..add kannada lyrics for all kannada songs..so many mistakes are there in English lyrics for kannada songs,NEGATIVE

"Keeps crashing on Samsung S20+, and the PLAY BAR is just randomly missing...so no controlls to start or stop content! Fix it",NEGATIVE
"SPOTIFY is changing, and not for the better.... They have finally gone ""woke"" Bands complete discography is no longer on the site.... It's a bunch of live stuff and artist radio! I used to love Spotify! Since you canceled artists I may have to cancel you, for good.... What a shame!",NEGATIVE
"Great music, easy to navigate, daily picks are spot on.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify and do t know what I'd do without it,POSITIVE
Love the wide variety of music available and the ability to create my own Playlist.,POSITIVE
"I've loved having Spotify premium for years now. I've got over hundreds of hours of content to listen to, multiple playlists and a myriad of podcasts I can listen to easily and seamlessly. Oh and they finally fixed the Android lock screen UI!",POSITIVE
A lot of people on here complaining about the free version as if it's supposed to operate differently than Pandora. Honestly as a paid member I just want the app to function properly. Tired of the player not being displayed whenever I'm in or out of the app though.,NEGATIVE
Nice and easy to use,POSITIVE
Love you guys.........I am a lover of music and I can get my filled with spotify......,POSITIVE
Best music/podcast app I have experience. I have the duo from my stepbrother & myself for $12.99 & it's really great we both get premium & can duo mix out playlist together if we want.,POSITIVE
"Amazing! Spotify is and always has been my favorite app for streaming and downloading music and podcasts. The only suggestion I would make is to get ahold of more b-sides, demos and rare cuts.",NEGATIVE
"I still love Spotify.. but what's up? The radio stations, my personal mixes.. they seem off. Sometimes it's just a playlist, not even radio, when I create a station?! It's just not the same. Bands that shouldn't be with the others, too much of the same band, repeating songs, different genres that don't mesh. I don't know what changed, but it makes me sad, I miss the old Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Given me the opportunity to explore music more thoroughly than local radio alone,POSITIVE
Amazing but you should add some then features from Apple music,POSITIVE
"Awesome will never go back to iHeartRadio or Pandora, Spotify is the way my brother lol...",NEGATIVE
Cannot stop the autoplay everytime I get in the car and my phone connects to the Bluetooth. I have to uninstall.,NEGATIVE
I can't log in. No internet connection prompt even though I'm connected.,NEGATIVE
Please fix. I have been fighting with this app for days. It keeps switching to shuffle mode even though I turn shuffle off. I am a paying member.,NEGATIVE
"Question? How come Spotify isn't paying me for teaching the younger generation about music? Makes sense to me, the less music gets forgotten the better.",NEGATIVE
"This app does 1 thing that no other app does. I can pause Spotify and not play anything for 3 hours, then when I disconnect my wireless buds it starts playing the previously paused music through my phone's speaker! FFS, just stay paused. Poor app, dodgy company, don't recommend anyone to pay for Spotify, it's a joke",NEGATIVE
"I am having issues when I cast my phone to my TV or PS5, the screen freezes on the first song I play, it's froze on that screen whether I go back to the main page or not. Cancelled my sub after a year without resolution. P.S. pay musicians more $$$ for their exploited work.",NEGATIVE
"Pay for premium but still lots of ads, what am I paying for?",NEGATIVE
Love the app BUT the notifications update is less manageable and an eye sore. Less was more. One star until it gets fixed/changed back.,NEGATIVE

"Theres some problem about the pc and android, for the pc you can like skipped the line but on android you cant",NEGATIVE
I always listen to my favorites on Spotify.,POSITIVE
Premium is well worth it. I plan to use my premium account for my upcoming wedding reception and on the drive down to Florida for my honeymoon. Overall the app is pretty good. No crashing so far,POSITIVE
Spotify has not been working for weeks. My while library is gone. Then when I click on a podcast it says no internet connection but I have internet. I have even Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it still did not fix it. I have been using this app for over 5 years and never had a issue like this. This is so frustrating!!! I have lost all my podcasts and music. Fix this!!!!,NEGATIVE
UNLIKE YOUTUBE I'M ABLE TO LISTEN AND DO OTHER THINGS ONLINE WITHOUT DISCONNECTING OR DROPPING A SONG.,POSITIVE
"The best make your favorite radio station and just listen. It's the best . Thanks that review was from 2020. Spotify is the best out there any song you can think of they have it. Podcasts they got em. Spotify has helped me though my Moms death,my 26 year old Macaw Harley and Most of all My Daughter Amy 46 Years Old Died 5/04/2021 and Spotify is what helps me get get on Best I Can and I Thank Them. Best Online Music!! Try It.",POSITIVE
"This app has great sound quality and is easy to use. I enjoy it. But I don't like how you have limited skips if you're a free listener and can't pick what song to play, the entire playlist just goes. I also don't like how the playlist automatically shuffles. What if you don't want it shuffled? Other than these issues and some pretty annoying but bearable ads, the app is great and I would recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify, it's just.. how I customize my liked playlist and I play it like how some people do and what happens while playing it. Well what I'm trying to get at is I am not happy with how my liked playlist plays recommended songs that I have to spend all of my skips to get to a song I actually like! Thus has happened more than once and more often, it even happened today.",NEGATIVE
Listen to Spotify all day every day the BEST app out there for musicðŸ¥°,POSITIVE

It continues to play a song that's not on one of my playlists when I try to play it,NEGATIVE
Easy and accessable for every song lyrics you want ðŸ’¯%âœ“,POSITIVE
Honestly the best app for music. Just hope that you could listen to songs offline bc some people cannot afford(or any other reason) unlimited data. For that 4 stars.,POSITIVE
"This is worth every penny, especially when combined with my nest. It's so much better than that yt music junk app. I miss Google music, but whatever this app is awesome and pretty cheap, so I still say it's a win!",POSITIVE
Spotify free added a new feature that makes it impossible to enjoy your liked songs playlist without adding back to back random songs that aren't even in the same genre of music you typically listen to. Overall just a begging for you to spend money on premium as if they don't have millions already. So stupid.,NEGATIVE
Music - 10/10 Price=8/10 Lyrics =8/10 now with lyrics but not really sincronized,NEGATIVE
"Too many ads, wrong adds. I am either classified by demographic or have an innacurate digital profile because all ads that I see are trash can fodder and mostly annoying.",NEGATIVE
Dont get this app it spends your data on stupid adds never get itðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Been using Spotify for over a year and still great. Thanx,POSITIVE

Everything about Spotify Is ..SPOT ON !I Love All Kinds Of MusicðŸ‘ðŸ’—,POSITIVE
"I have to cancel, or at least change my payment method for Spotify, but I can'f do it through the app and the website automatically redirects me to the app. I now have a $-54 balance due to overdraft fees and I can't pay that.",NEGATIVE
The App used to be great. Lately it is so ridiculously flawed I'm not even sure why I'm paying for premium anymore. To keep things short it simply doesn't function. Too must frustration for what its worth.,NEGATIVE
Love how user friendly it is!,POSITIVE
"I have the premium because I'm music obsessed. I hope their pricing policy does not change. With give playlists - one of which has over 20 hours of songs - I could get billed for more than ten and change a month. So the limitless on the size of playlists is awesome, and I can look to add music at any time.",POSITIVE
Really aggravated when you're listening to classic country with family and then No Filter by ASTAR starts playing.,NEGATIVE
All is good but ads are disturbing while listening songs either all are good in this App and have all songs,NEGATIVE
Great app to find and listen to music with basically no ads,POSITIVE
Love the freedom of primer but I still get adverts.,POSITIVE
"I really enjoy listening to SPOTIFY, especially when there is an artist's music I want to listen to.",POSITIVE
I love this honestly or her music apps are rip offs and this is so simple to use but I wish I could do 10 skips I've used this app 3+ years. But I would recommend this music app. <3,POSITIVE
Best app for music hands down available on all platforms at an affordable price,POSITIVE
"All right, Spotify has improved their flaws and bugs. Yay!!! Now it's back to greatness.",POSITIVE

Hi I love this app so much but there is only 1 problem why I can't open ishowspeed shake song can. U please fix this ;( i can't quit this app I love it so much,POSITIVE
"Still no higher resolution music, lol. It's laughable at this point ðŸ˜‚ Algorithms need to go deeper into alternate band suggestions. Also song suggestions played through the algorithm needs to go deeper into alternate song selection. Spotify usually only gives you the couple of popular songs. While your algorithm is written well, it thin in it's results. Thanks",NEGATIVE
Great playlists to make you dance,POSITIVE
Adds might be annoying for sleep and I don't feel like paying premium,NEGATIVE
"Spotify needs to add a way to selectively move more songs at once from one playlist to another. And we need more pins for playlists, 4 aren't enough",NEGATIVE
Turns off stops all the time the worst app ever,NEGATIVE
"I would've given 5 stars but the app, it's logged out from spotify. And I can't log in anymore. Pls fix the app!!",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify there are no ads if you subscribe which is worth every penny and there are hundreds of thousands of songs and podcasts to listen to and if you have children who like music there is a restricted setting.

I have no clue why people put bad Reviews on this app it is actually not as bad as these people describe it. There is adds but how else would they make money I mean there's not that many sooo that should not be something to be complained about. This app has a variety of songs so I think this app it amazing.,POSITIVE
the only thing i dont like is that i cant close the app and have music playing still. A habit of mine to clear out my apps.,NEGATIVE
App is constantly crashing. Also constantly adds songs to my que although I turned off the song suggestion option. Make it make sense.,POSITIVE
Love how Spotify automatically connects to my car. No need to go into my phone and open the app.,POSITIVE
Too much ads are there even when Spotify showed 30min of ad free music I've seen ads.,NEGATIVE
"I really like the app, I would give Spotify a 5 star rating if there weren't so many adds and premium features, on my Xbox it lets me choose what songs I want to listen to and have infinite skips. But when I'm on my phone I have to shuffle play random songs, I also don't like how Spotify adds songs to my playlist, I keep hiding them but there are more getting added every day, I would appreciate it if you guys would just have a recommendation list under the songs, but don't play them.",NEGATIVE
Easy-to-use and so much music,POSITIVE
I like Spotify because it's different from the other musical apps that I have and I like the moving pictures with some of the songs â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
"Works well in this build. No crashes or anything. I like the interface but it definitely could be designed better to access certain features or lists. Still, great app overall.",NEGATIVE
"Great UI, expansive catalogue, and instantaneous music starts. It's the head of the pack, currently.",POSITIVE
I would literally DIE if I didn't have my premium... Been using this for almost 12yrs and have discovered so much beautiful music thank you Spotify if I didn't have my doggo you'd be my best friend!,POSITIVE
Please can you fix thiss i cant log into my acount and it is a premium acount since last night please fix thiss,NEGATIVE
"I absolutely hate this app now. You took away everything i loved about it, I can no longer loop the songs nor can I play a song when a different song is playing. I updated it and that is not the issue. I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this WHATSOEVER.",NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
The app is just great I don't get a commercial after every song and this is just my go to app for music ðŸ˜ƒ.,POSITIVE
Pretty much unusable in mobile unless you listen to podcasts or buy premium,NEGATIVE
The best 1000 percent u can find any song and music,POSITIVE
"Works great and the option to download songs and music is handy, did have a problem with playing music while my phone was off or the app not on screen and it would suddenly stop playing music but I reinstalled and waiting to see if it's fixed.",NEGATIVE
Its good. One of the Legal free music apps :),POSITIVE
"I used to use this all the time. But recently it deleted everything I had on my Playlist, and forgot who I was, and I've already tried deleting it and reinstalling it. It didn't fix it. What the hell Spotify? Why did your mobile app forget who I was but not my ps4 app version?",NEGATIVE
"Earlier Spotify had 1 advertisement at a time inbetween, then it becomes 2 addvertisement at a time, now it become 3 addvertisement at a time.",NEGATIVE
Add an option to clear the whole queue in one go! Takes too phone storage.,NEGATIVE

Actually this app is so amazing i love it it gives me what i want. You guys should keep it up i love this app very nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Why are the ads way louder than the music?? They play 3 ads between only 2 songs. The premium price is high like Netflix. You can't go through albums and add songs you have to type each individual song to add. You can only add a lot through other Playlist but not artist albums.,NEGATIVE
Music on tap and music for the moment.,POSITIVE
"No option to cancel subscription, and the only other option is filling out a professional letter on why I'm cancelling my plan, which is the most unnecessary thing ever, not one company has done this before or proven to be this incompetent with its own management for subscriptions",NEGATIVE
"Been a Spotify Premium member for years and wouldn't change a thing. It's the gold standard in streaming music. Quite simply, Apple Music was too late to the party and I've never felt the need to switch. Spotify gets everything right, hands down.",NEGATIVE
The music quality is amazing! Music is my stress relief and Spotify makes it an easy way to feel better. I love creating new playlists (I have like wayyyyy to many lmao.) Spotify premium with no adds is also definitely worth the money! I remember when I used to have to listen to adds and it really killed the vibe. 11/10 would recommend !!!!,POSITIVE
Best way to listen to the type of music I enjoy. Fantastic.,POSITIVE
The music that mixes with my library is very good I like it ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Very good collection of songs,POSITIVE

Closes randomly during podcasts. No clue why S22 galaxy,NEGATIVE
"spotify is pretty amazing i'd say, but recently the new update im not sure but there's this update abt the widget colour being blue, n in my opinion it's kind of ugly, before this the widget coulour would change according to the album cover but idk what happened now its only blue, maybe its the new update but i hope to get the previous one back, it looks so much better n nicer.",NEGATIVE
"Seriously? I'm taking back 4 stars back. Heard ""Dekhu tuje ya kudrat ke najare"" even though I don't give a blink about this type of songs; heard the advertisement one week in a row repeatedly. If your ads are good I'll consider upgrading one day. Thank you.",POSITIVE
Spotify is okay but sometimes when I'm looking for an artist and want to play a full album they put me in the artist radio which plays random artists of that style difficult to determine what I want,NEGATIVE
"It doesn't work properly. Constantly shuts off middle of songs, the play bar doesnt show, fed up with it honestly. Gonna switch to a diff music streamer",NEGATIVE
Shittiest app ever every time I go to a song I pick it goes to some random song I've never heard before,NEGATIVE
"They killed (deprecated, as they say) support for the app to function with my Pioneer stereo, and that was the only reason to have it. Considering cancelling my paid sub and looking for something else.",NEGATIVE
All the music I want whenI want it.,POSITIVE
Best music app in history â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE

The greatest music App Ever created wow!,POSITIVE
I love listening to music and listening to podcasts ðŸ˜Œ boywithuke long drives this is one of my favorite song's,POSITIVE
Awesome music app where you can listen to the music from your own library or suggested daily mixes and different genres.,POSITIVE
Horrible when I make a Playlist it always adds songs I don't care about or don't like,NEGATIVE
"Basically, its none of the much, but it is in concerned with the privacy of users. So, I would like to point it out. ""In android there is a feature which allows users to hide all notification in screen lock. But spotify does not follow the same."" In next update make sure to get this one. Overall, app is doing great.",POSITIVE
I just love the app and I am using it since long,POSITIVE
Why did you have to remove Driving Mode? It was perfect. Now I have to use alternatives that are not even close to what Driving Mode was.,NEGATIVE
Love that I can download the music I love!So easy to use!!!,POSITIVE
Spectacular and moving. Loved it...,POSITIVE
"Music is downloaded, still won't show songs without an Internet connection. Once is looses a connection the app needs re starting again before it'll search",NEGATIVE
Very best app. Great. But reduce the ads.,NEGATIVE
In the new update a feature has been deleted. Like when you want to add songs to one of your playlists you cannot play the demo part So it's impossible to add songs that have the same vibe as your playlist... I also would like a feature that you can chat with your friends on spotify and send them music...,NEGATIVE
Best app for listening songs :),POSITIVE
I wish we can download the songs and please the management should add sleep timer option in the settings no other objections but the app is very good,POSITIVE
Spotify has stopped working on my phone. It wont load at all.,NEGATIVE
I pay for premium and still get ads. Ads are flaming piles of ****. Â£14 a month for my podcasts to be interupted by adverts.,NEGATIVE
Paying for premium..can't access my download song without data fix this please,NEGATIVE
"Does not work on VIVO X80 PRO !!!!!!!!!!! You hear that, Spotify support team ???? Thank you for the newest version update, it works beautifully !!! You screwed it up again with the latest version ðŸ¤¬ 7th June 22 : now the latest version works !!! Please make sure future updates are workable for VIVO X80 PRO 21st June 22: now I dare not update, afraid that the latest version don't work!???",NEGATIVE
Crashes repeatedly. Has come to the point where it's not even worth fighting with to listen to music and podcasts.,NEGATIVE
I've been using Spotify for years and it's only gotten better! Best music app!,NEGATIVE
"Asks me to turn on Bluetooth, every time i start/change to the app",NEGATIVE
Best streaming platform I've used soo far,POSITIVE
Works good. Good music,POSITIVE
I think Spotify is great! However we should have the option mixes if we want the clean or explicit version. It's the same song we might as well be able to choose. Because sometimes I need to choose. I also feel we should be able to peek at the next song before we skip it. We only get 6 skips an hour I don't want to use them if I don't have to.,NEGATIVE
After update Spotify Start laging when we play a song it takes a second to start the song,NEGATIVE
The thing I love about Spotify is if you have something you're listening to and you listen to it can you come back the next day and listen to it again I just love this app and it has every song you can think of.,POSITIVE
"THIS APP IS THE BEST! But When i make playlist, Spotify says that he put random songs in, so that's IRITATING! (pls fix thatðŸ¥º)",NEGATIVE
Definitely helps the work day pass much smoother,POSITIVE
"I regret every minute I had not realised there such an app, I really love it.",POSITIVE
"I don't like Spotify at first but my gf insisted on getting the premium, and I fell in love. You can download songs for offline. Skip songs. Love it.",POSITIVE
"5 stars if you have premium. By far best music and podcast service. Totally worth paying for premium, especially if you can do a Family, duo, or student plan. Without premium ads are very annoying, and you can't select songs, only shuffle playlists.",NEGATIVE
I have been using Spotify for many years. It is an amazing music player I have ever seen.,POSITIVE
"how are you about to give me 3 ads, let 1 song play, THEN give me 3 MORE ads?",NEGATIVE
"This app consistently disconnects every Bluetooth device when I open it. I can use every other app and Bluetooth device without issue, yet Spotify routinely disconnects my devices upon opening. New changes to the UI make it more difficult to see artists catelogue and to select desires music. I use this app because it holds my playlists and my friends upload their content on it. Otherwise, I use YouTube and simply skip ads after 5 seconds.",NEGATIVE
One of the best music app ever I see,POSITIVE
Easy to use! Great options for listening!,POSITIVE
"I do love my spot. The only thing that bugs me, (NOT SPOTIFYS FAULT) is when the artists pull their music. But hey, it's their choice, their money. I have premium so I never get ads.",POSITIVE
Please can there be an option to download music for offline? Thank you,POSITIVE
"Ads are like commercial breaks (I have had 8 ads one time) and several songs I listen to are blocked. And when I turn my phone off and listen, the music will skip like a CD.",NEGATIVE
Very good app lots of content available for listening,POSITIVE
I had a good experience ðŸ˜Œ in listening the song it's makes me ðŸ˜Š happy and relax me and one thing I Don't need to care about the screen off because when it's screen off it's playing on and it is auto shuffling ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ,NEGATIVE
At first it was good then this annoying update came now I can't play the song I want in my playlists and I can't skip I don't like this new update.please fix it,NEGATIVE
"I don't really like how you can't listen to previews when you press the add songs button ( new update, free version) can you please change it back.",NEGATIVE
please let us people who don't have premium turn off shuffle playlist,NEGATIVE
Superb app very less ads i am happy ðŸ‘âœŒï¸,NEGATIVE
Good music Good app no ads,POSITIVE
It's great but I only gave it four stars because you have to pay to listen to it offline and to skip unlimited songs and I understand they use it to make money I just wish it was different,NEGATIVE
"If you like loud music Spotify is not for you, I have premium and I tried all the settings and equalizer and the volume doesn't compare to SoundCloud or others. Every app sounds fine in headphones except for Spotify. Volume limiting is un-American and shouldn't be allowed or what's the point of having expensive headphones?",NEGATIVE
Too much add can't stop add need to buy premium package for ad free music such a pathetic experience,NEGATIVE
"great, but there are adds 24/7",POSITIVE
It's really hard to find the song you want they are mixed,NEGATIVE
"it's not playing the song i was clicking, kindly fix it?",NEGATIVE
"Force closes too often, can't report problems because that force closes too",NEGATIVE
They are giving soo much ad hardly you can listen 2 song. After 2 song ad will come,NEGATIVE
Once was innovative and well-engineered application. Now it just simply stops playing for no reason.,NEGATIVE
I've used spotify for awhile now and I really like it the only thing I've figured out recently was that you can no longer play a clip of the song while you are putting it on your playlist which allows you to hear the song before you add it. I honestly think you guys should but it back because maybe people would like to hear the song before adding it to their playlist because I sure do,NEGATIVE
Why does a music streaming app take up 5GB of memory space when I don't even download the music,NEGATIVE
Song recommendations can be better. Many songs overlap in different playlists,NEGATIVE
I downloaded songs and they're not playing why I'm paying for them so I should be able to listen to all of my with on promises right the song that's not downloaded is playing come on now get right I'm paying money to listen my music from spotify I have told others people about spotify and now you're messing up come on now get it right.,NEGATIVE
"I'm not a fan of the Only 6 skips per hour thing for people like me who don't have premium lol But I like spotify, recommendations of songs are amazing too",POSITIVE
I put my liked songs on shuffle and it plays the same 30 songs on a loop.,NEGATIVE
I love this app so much i can listen to every single music in high quality. I just have a little bit problem with ads or nothing,POSITIVE
"This is the first time I have used this app, so I don't have much to report. So far I like it... I'll leave another comment about this once I use it a bit.",POSITIVE
"It's good,, but middle middle add's problem. Please remove add's. Tq",NEGATIVE
This app is very good and very comfortable to use you can also see lyrics and sound experiance is very good and there is no risk for hacking i have 6 years experience for spotify,POSITIVE
The app is really very good. It is easy to use. The only drawback is the mistakes in lyrics,POSITIVE

"It's a good app, but really restricting for free user.",NEGATIVE
"I don't know why I can download songs, because the app doesn't work without internet and sometimes not even with it.",NEGATIVE
Your irritating ads every 10 mins are not encouraging me to buy premium but rather switch to switch to some other app.,NEGATIVE
It was really a great app I can listen musics ofc its great ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
For some reason I can't listen to my Spotify on any of my Bluetooth devices. Really upset with this!!!! Don't know that I will continue with this app.,NEGATIVE
Incredible! I love this app!,POSITIVE
"Well aside from even the non premium still being good, If you are a student, couple, family or just a single person trying to not have ads they have premium for you with special offers. Also if you don't want to pay the price they always have deals that pop up if you have been using them! I got 3 months of premium for just $1 that is insane I love it.",POSITIVE
"The control panel(where I can see which song us playing or I can pause/play a song) doesn't appear , app is not functional at all like this",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming app,POSITIVE
Better than I thought... damn! Keep the awesome work.,POSITIVE
I love it i can find diffrent kinds of songs without a problem,POSITIVE
"I use this app all of the time on multiple different devices, and it's always great. I don't have premium so I get ads, but I wish the ads were almost always different. Most of the time it ends up being like the same 5",NEGATIVE
The music app that I am most fond of.,POSITIVE
"Premium is worth it, and I'd rate this at 5 stars if they would put more effort into the Premium exclusive group sessions and make it actually work better other then that it's a good App for music and works great on Xbox and phone",POSITIVE
I'm not able to add some song in playlist ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž,NEGATIVE
Good for music BUT TOO MANY ADS,NEGATIVE
Please add a multi select feature,POSITIVE
"I cant even play the songs i want to listen, it has to be on the random playlist",NEGATIVE
The app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts. The worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast I'm listening to skips right to the end. Total waste of time,NEGATIVE
Keeps crashing and won't play my downloaded episodes without my data being on. Which defeats the purpose,NEGATIVE
It's a good app ! Just needs more variety in the mixing.,NEGATIVE
This app has solved lots of problems to people around the world and is also very helpful ...thus is a great and very reliable app,POSITIVE
I have to keep re downloading the app because the app freezes on a song or podcast episode which means it will carry on playing without the possibility to change to another episode.,NEGATIVE
APP KEEPS CRASHING. Trash back-end.,NEGATIVE

Super easy to use,POSITIVE
"Seamless streaming, intuitive recommendations and every artist you could hope to find.",POSITIVE
This is the best music stream app ever â¤,POSITIVE

Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release,POSITIVE

"The largest selection of music, podcasts and easy to use",POSITIVE
"This app has over a 100 songs but there's still a lot of songs,albums and even podcasts that it is missing. If there's an app that has lot's of songs I want A LOT. Also why is there so many blocked songs like time/Breathe reprise by the flaming lips.

"I love this app. I was on JOOX, until it subtracted from South Africa. I find Spotify way better. The suggested tracks and albums created for me is cool. I just mis that I could give my own compilation folders a single image of my own on Joox. I will give 5 stars if that could be added.",NEGATIVE

"I've been using Spotify for quite a long time. But lately whenever I play a playlist, it doesn't play the songs that are suppose to be made by the artist.

Many advertisements comes in this app,NEGATIVE
"I like this app because I can listen to songs even if we exit the app, the song is still played and we can control it through other devices, only we use the phone and it's better than YouTube music",POSITIVE
I love the app very much the only thing is after the new update I've how do I put this on a good way I've been not rlly liking the new update can you pls fix it. ( I really wanna play my fav song :'D ),NEGATIVE

"The best app ever I love Spotify alot, the music and everything",POSITIVE
Brilliant App... very functional and apt for the gospel music uses I desire of it etc.,POSITIVE
It's awful after it asks for a rating even you do it you cant listen what you to anymore it takes you to a random playlist and you can only click shuffle and maybe if your lucky you can eventually listen to the song you wanted,NEGATIVE

I am rating this app 1 star because Spotify removed a very important feature i.e. removing the recently played. That feature was very much needed because you might accidentally play something you didn't mean to,NEGATIVE
"Since my last review was deleted....long story short disgusting monetized app, since you guys make lots of money from the adds you guys put avery 2-3 songs (like 2-3 adds)....why block some futures under premium?

Easy for a novice to use!,NEGATIVE
"Normally a good app, but the bug where Spotify randomly closes itself is back. Especially once you lock the screen",NEGATIVE
"I've strong network connection but sometimes this app shows there is a network problem so that lyrics can't be load. Don't know why does it happens! And after 2 or 3 Times reboot, the app shows the lyrics, you know when you're looking for lyrics and lyrics aren't here, it ruins the mood",NEGATIVE

I had written the password down and never changed it. I could get into my email that the account is registered to my account, only it's has parental control's and my mom won't allow me into it until im 18, for whatever reason.

UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird,NEGATIVE
When you have premium with no ads or recommended songs it's really good and you can listen offline and all the fun things plus you can listen to stuff on repeat which is nice. So in all this app is a great music streaming app,POSITIVE
Keeps skipping even with full 5G service. Pandora plays straight through on same signal with no problem so I know it's this app.,NEGATIVE
"Ads are out of control, an ad every 2 songs and sometimes it will play 2 30 sec ads in a row or play a 20 minute ad that i can't skip while I'm working",NEGATIVE
"I mean, some of the songs I wanna listen to are free on here that aren't on Spotify. I don't get why I can't have a single song on a playlist without having to shuffle through a bunch of others that were recommended to me. I can't even choose which one I gotta listen to. It's just shuffle until it plays. Honestly a horrible design in general.",NEGATIVE
Very good app for listenind every type of musicðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,POSITIVE
Most reliable streaming app which brings my favorite songsðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥,POSITIVE
"Since the update Spotify won't play the next episode of a podcast, or the next song in an album or playlist. Instead, a random song plays and even after trying to go back to the playlist or podcast and physically tapping the next in queue, it plays another random song and keeps doing that until the 4th or 5th tap when it FINALLY selects the song...only to play another random song after. This is a ridiculous bug I'm paying for.",NEGATIVE

Always crashes. Worst app ever. Only have it because of Rogan,NEGATIVE
So far better than streaming MP3's on your phone so much better especially for all of us poor people in this covid time of time of breaking businesses so I guess everything is free now and that as well be because people are working so hard for no reason we might as well listen to something that's peaceful. But don't get me wrong we should still work. Only because we want to and we should do it just to help.,POSITIVE
Crashes whenever I try to add music to my playlist,NEGATIVE
"The ease, price point, and quality of the streaming service make this an excellent music application. A radio edit section or censored section would make it even easier to operate.",POSITIVE
I downloaded Spotify a couple of minutes ago and while using the app it kicked me out and I tried and tried but it's won't let me! I deleted it and right now I'm installing it back so hopefully it works! (I'll change my review when it works) Update: It works now! â€¹3,POSITIVE
"I really hate this app, i can't even listen to the music i like because you have to be premium, really don't recommend this and would prefer any othe music app",NEGATIVE
Some times u get an ad after 2 songs. Sometimes u get 20 mins of music before listening to an add. Was 5 stars but now 3 stars,NEGATIVE
I regret downloading this app. YouTube music is a lot better. I don't understand why I am listening to a song I'm not able to prepare fora song that I would like to play next. I have to scroll throuh My list of songs and then wait for the song to finish and then press the next song. YouTube music doesn't do this. Also I hate the exit button on this app. I have to go and manually press one of the symbols on the app for me to get out of a certain song instead of just pressing the back button,NEGATIVE
Love my music and to be able to play anywhere great deals with accounts for whole family,POSITIVE

"Spotify in a nutshell: ""hey this person is genuinely enjoying this song/playlist & playing it often. Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! ðŸ˜€"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs. I'm giving this 4 stars since u don't respond to ur 1 star reviews. fix the system.",NEGATIVE
Idk what's wrong with this app .it's says no internet connection on the search page even tho I'm listening to music at the same time I can't search for any songs i could only play songs from my playlist.now I'm not even able to login my account .fix this asap,NEGATIVE

"The update is absolutely disappointing. I shuffled my ""liked songs"" and then suddenly another song which I never had heard started playing. I tried to skip it, but more random songs kept playing! From what I remember, it's just my liked songs. I never heard those songs before. Even if I try to skip all the songs, it wouldn't work because apparently we could only skip a few songs per hour, please let people listen to music in peace. Might aswell just use ytube.",NEGATIVE
I literally just downloaded the app but I think it's amazing because it has good music and it plays your music even when your not on the app,POSITIVE
Why the hell are there so many ads that try to get you to by spotify premium,NEGATIVE
"I absolutely, positively love â¤ï¸ this app.",POSITIVE
"Works pretty well, good music selection. Has the same issues as Spotify on a pc.",POSITIVE
Love it listen to it daily,POSITIVE
I love it I work in a place where you get no signal I mean zero signal on the floor and I can listen to my podcast all day if I just download it here I love this app I'm happy I found it,POSITIVE
"I use to have spotify in a tablet and in the spotify I would pick the song I wanted to listen, my playlist would go in order, and the best thing is that I could change the other of the songs from my playlist from my favorite to less favorite it was awesome I did like that, but the phone version is horrible I can't even pick the song I want to listen to the songs come all random and the worst thing is the I can't even order my songs from my playlist ðŸ˜¡ so spotify fix your app pls ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
STOP MAKING ME PLAY YOU STUPID RECOMMENDED SONGS I WANNA PLAY MY OWN SONGS IM UNINSTALLING THIS APP,NEGATIVE
I love it but if you don't have a connection it's useful,POSITIVE
Best app ever super fast extremly useful and best music and podcast just about anything you can think of they got it and its completly free,POSITIVE
"1) If I search for a song, I dont want a shuffled playlist that contains that song somewhere in it. I want to listen to that song. 2) Why does changing playlists/songs instantly start another round of ads for 30min of ad free music, if I literally just got done listening to 3 ads saying I have 30min of free music? Get more accuracy and less ads on Youtube all places...",NEGATIVE
Love just about everything except the 30 minute ad free feature no longer works. App is up to date and after watching an ad to get 30 minutes ad free you're lucky if you get 10 to 15 minutes before another set of ads. Without that 5 stars no problem.,NEGATIVE
Ver good songs app in every language,POSITIVE
Dude. Been trying to open the app for days. I have premium and it's getting wasted ugh.,NEGATIVE
It's great because you can sit back and relax Wyle listening to Spotify,POSITIVE
I enjoy the old school music from the 60 and 70 r&b jazz thank you,POSITIVE
"Great selection of music, but lyrics, not so much.",NEGATIVE
"You know why I hate this app, the old version was so good there was no premium and other ads. Spotify got worse!",NEGATIVE
Best music app out..HANDS DOWN,NEGATIVE
This app crashes 10 times a day without fail. Fix this garbage.,NEGATIVE
seriously so good. their system is great. music wow ðŸ˜».,POSITIVE
It adds songs to my playlist that I never wanted on there. And the 30 minutes no ads thing is only about 10.,POSITIVE
Outstanding on every level....Premium is well worth it,POSITIVE
It's good for music but I really don't like it when it mixes up my songs with ones that aren't on my Playlist it really makes me mad and when I can reshuffle to not listen to those songs,NEGATIVE
No matter what I do I can't make it play jre podcasts offline and even if I'm playing with an internet connection it still glitches and won't work if I pause it for more then a few seconds. It will also stop working after commercials play and sometimes randomly skip to a different podcast and lose all progress on the previous one. But I can't get jre anywhere else so I'm stuck with this garbage. Update this app still super sucks if you can find an alternative then run away from this app!,NEGATIVE
Excellent at all times,POSITIVE
Easy to filter and set favorites,POSITIVE
"You are celebrating black artists this month, which month is for white artists? ""Inclusion is Universal"", unless you are of European descent. How long has Spotify been using racism in advertising? Perhaps an Ombudsman should be contacted.",POSITIVE
It's absolutely good app comparing others for listening every type of music without any trouble,POSITIVE
"A great place to catalog your music, but but everytime they update this app. They make it objectively worse. For some reason everytime they make it harder to find tour music and it infuriates me to no end",NEGATIVE
"App no longer works properly for me. I can start music or a podcast but it stays on a blank home screen. Doesn't show what's currently playing at all. Also can't pause or interact in any way with toolbar. The only way to stop a song or podcast is to completely close the app. Cleared the cache and checked for updates but nothing. The last time Spotify worked properly for me was when I paid for premium, which is interesting. The only thing stopping me from deleting is that Pandora is somehow worse",NEGATIVE
Ease of use. It would great if the app can remember the lat podcast I was on.,NEGATIVE
"Amazing. I love it so much, it's very good quality. It has all the songs I like. Don't really have that much to say except for it's a really amazing app.",POSITIVE
Any other music app os better than this,NEGATIVE
Love my Spotify Premium!,POSITIVE
"Cool, stress less, and satisfying",POSITIVE
I hate how there's adverts then 2 songs you can't skip. I'm sorry but I'm not buying premium either. The app use to be better. Now it's horrible,NEGATIVE
"I'm fairly new to the app, but I've love listening pretty much all day long - with only breaks to charge my ear buds! I've exclusively been listening to BTS and there are some great suggestions that I hadn't heard yet. So Thanks, Spotify! I like that I can add to favorites & there's a cool feature to also skip songs (which the button is too close to the Next button, but that's cuz I shove my phone in a pocket and it's accessible from the lock screen- which is handy and not sometimes) Thank you!",POSITIVE
Finding searching played a lot Travis Scott Kanye West Jay z musics highest hits Spotify has best bet VEVO utmost hard to get some played Spotify relates source finds quality ensuring listeners,POSITIVE
Listening to 2 songs = hearing 7 ads,NEGATIVE
The cerator of this app you need fix all the bugs with your app,NEGATIVE
"What's happened? Spotify just stop working with no reason. Since the last update the app just stop off working for NOTHING. The Spotify's premium users, should have more quality. What's whong?",NEGATIVE
Thanks for bringing back the playlist button. Now it's perfect.,POSITIVE
The app is very slow and stopped working so I contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and Uninstall then reinstall. In 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again. I have not been able to listen to anything since right after I was billed and when I asked for a refund it said I couldn't bc is was past 14 days but I paid on the 6th and it's the 19th so it hadn't even been 14 days.,NEGATIVE
Easiest music app ive used. Been using it for ten years.,NEGATIVE
wth.. 2 ads was tolerable but 5??,NEGATIVE
I only got to listen one day. But I think it's pretty cool.,POSITIVE
Always great music!,POSITIVE
"Spotify stream good less data consumption fast and good taping ,one thing i dont like is the volume my devices it dosnt boost sounds good the way i want pls let the developer of this App still work on the sounf production thanks",POSITIVE
Not even going to lie I've been a hardcore Spotify listener for going on 3-4 years now and I never took the time to do a review. But check it out I recommend Spotify to anybody who likes music more than most of the people that surround them. I would vouch for Spotify to anybody on this Earth and before God admit that I have been blessed with playlists that hit the spot. Spotify something I've taken for granted a lot of times. 100% download Spotify right now!!!!,POSITIVE
Doesn't display what song I'm playing on my phone anymore..,NEGATIVE
"Loving it. Keep me going all day. Great app, music for all ages.",POSITIVE
I consider my musical taste as extremely eclectic. Spotify allows me to indulge in my eclecticism. For you to appreciate what I mean check out my playlist ECLECTIC IMAGES on Spotify.,POSITIVE
Nice audio experience and with lyrics it's amazing. But you're showing too much of ads which makes it irritating to use. Showing ads are ok but you are showing it frequently. This will make the users to pissed off including me. Solve this ads issue in the next update. Three stars are fair enough to give according to me.,POSITIVE
Very nice app once you have premium (only $10)Easy to use and always has the newest music.,POSITIVE
Great content but adds are becoming annoying and app is very unstable and crashes constantly.....,NEGATIVE
I enjoy Spotify for it's ease of use.,POSITIVE
"Love this app & the team behind it. Once I had a problem on my PC: Arch Linux, Gnome desktop environment and they managed to fix it within a single day! Nothing I would expect from such a big company.",POSITIVE
"On my s20 fe , the app loves to disengage activity on bluetooth with my ford sync making me have to end the app through settings with force stop. Music will play and become unchangeable in the app or from my car as well as when I disconnect (getting out of my truck) it will endlessly play on the phone until I do so. I used to love the feature of it having a widget on my lock screen and my drop down menu but for some reason it doesn't exist anymore, at least on my phone. Idk, been here since 2016",NEGATIVE
All good. It would be great if there was an overall function to have everything in 8D once headphones are plugged in. Like a GENERAL FEATURE.,POSITIVE
"Everything is great, except one major issue, the recomended for this list... list, is mainly the exact version of the songs i have in my list, this is really my only problem",NEGATIVE
"Terrible to use lately, lags horribly, makes it pain to even use.",NEGATIVE
"The app keeps adding non selected music into my liked songs list, that I have not idea that such songs existed ðŸ˜ .",NEGATIVE
Love that I can listen to music with no advert,POSITIVE
Where the hell has the queue button gone?! Please bring this back,NEGATIVE
"Fantastic so far, one of my favourite apps!",POSITIVE
"What a buggy disappointment! First, it said premium has no ads and that is wrong. I subbed for the 30 day premium promo and there are most definitely ads during Rogan's podcast that I have FF to get through. Secondly, this app is so buggy! 2 times now the video stops playing and clearing cache don't work. First time I had to uninstall and reinstall and video just went out for a second time just now. So looks like round two of uninstalling and reinstalling now! Thankfully it's a free trial.",NEGATIVE
Good music at all time,POSITIVE
Sometimes the song I want is preempted by another song.,NEGATIVE
I love this app. i can listen to whatever kind of music i want and i love that kind of freedom.,POSITIVE
Amazing!I've got my favorite songs old and new from A-Z completed. Thanks Spotify,POSITIVE
"App has become a bloatware pos. Too many ads, too frequently, and too LONG. Not paying for this joke just to avoid your spam, and the spam has become the app. Updated: it has only gotten worse in the past year. By my estimate 1/3 of the time the app is 'playing' is now ads. Absolutely not worth wasting time on.",NEGATIVE
"I listen to spotify when I'm doing homework, on my way to work in my truck, on my spot spa sound machine at work. I am always tuned in. My son @JWatt is on spotify!",POSITIVE
"awesome app, love the podcasts!",POSITIVE
"Best music app, better than apple music which I had before",POSITIVE
:( Bug that won't let me add any new personalized playlist photos. Says I should check my wifi connection. (which works perfectly fine.),POSITIVE
Can the search be quicker? Maybe priorities musician then song title then lyrics last? Thank you for the service! May the Father of Heaven give you hope and a love and a knowledge of God. May you know the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be faithful.,POSITIVE
"An amazing music platform, makes it easy to find new music, share music with my friends, and there are even a ton of optional social features that really make Spotify special. I only wish you could pin more playlists",POSITIVE
"Was five stars, but only recently I see that I simply cannot just open local audio files without Spotify opening then up. Have changed the slider in settings and it still happens. If I don't get an answer to this to resolve the way it was, I am unsubscribing.",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming,POSITIVE
"dont download, stupid app, says Im losing followers on my artist profile when I know for a fact due to my self promotions and screenshots from facebook I have been gaining followers, adds songs you didnt want to your playlist, and the list goes on and on, what are you upto spotify, you earning so much money that you dont care about your users experience, your going to find your going to lose alot of subscribers due to your subpar platform, stupid app",NEGATIVE
"Since the last update, my Spotify is very slow to non responsive.. I get a black screen that takes about 3 minutes then gives me a time out message..",NEGATIVE
"Wish there was a cheaper option.$9.99 a month just to be able to skip more, replay, and skip backwards is ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
Excellent variety of music and information. Recommendations for music are spot on!,POSITIVE
I guess good for everyone who likes to listen to music offline mode but.. other than that is pretty good 9.5/10.,POSITIVE
Is good for music not to meny adds,POSITIVE
"This is bad, u can only get 6 skips per hour? And sometimes it doesn't even play ur list music like war the heck man! This is a horrible app",NEGATIVE
I dont like your playlists and have turned off. Either play what I request or I will get my music elsewhere.,NEGATIVE
Its realy nice but my one problem is that you can't put the same song more than 1 time on a playlist.,NEGATIVE
All the music I love for free with the odd commercial- how can one complain!,NEGATIVE
I love this app but it pos the song wuns in a Wiyll. Sorry ubawt my words. I am a kid.ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶,NEGATIVE
I have this app in my phone. But after 1 mo. it stopped in my car. Saying it is free + built in my $800. phone why does it say I need to pay $10. a month. Confused!!,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is my main means of listening to music, which makes it rather annoying that the app keeps randomly crashing either a few seconds after starting it or even in the middle of songs. Not a great user experience right now!",NEGATIVE
The app isn't that bad however to access to cancel a subscription is a process when on a Android device.,NEGATIVE
This is probably the best app to listen to music,POSITIVE
Best music app i have downloaded ever..I am surprised why I didn't get it before ðŸ¤¦,POSITIVE
Find almost every song I want.,POSITIVE
"So , you want everyone to be a premium user . Ads after every w songs sometimes 1 song , i quit it",NEGATIVE

Cost a lot but the service is very good.,POSITIVE
"No adds and able to listen to complete albums,concerts particularly.",POSITIVE

I can play a Playlist on my car with Bluetooth. Works great.,POSITIVE
"Since the last update the app has not worked, I go to my liked songs and it says try again and anytime I go to a Playlist it says this Playlist is empty. It won't play any songs. Before the update it was working ok aside from it pausing for no reason.",NEGATIVE
"Provides a well of options, free and easy to use...i mean... What else can you ask for",POSITIVE
"Spotify is better than Amazon Prime. It has a large amount of options from music, podcasts, and books. There are very few searches I have made that came up empty. It is less expensive than Amazon Prime with more to give.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, amazing variety of songs and podcasts, only bad thing is a few to many adds even with premium",POSITIVE
It always glitches out and then says nothing playing even though something is playing and then the only way to get it back is to update the app.,NEGATIVE
I love how even if your phone is off you can still listen to your playlist ect if I could give this 100 stars I would!,POSITIVE
Music is skipping so bad. I've had Spotify for over 10 years and I can't even get through a song without it skipping over 20 times. I am so frustrated. I think I am going to have to cancel. I don't know what else to do.,NEGATIVE
"When you pay for premium service and spend months curating playlists just for them to randomly disappear. Much great, such wow..",POSITIVE
"Way too many ads. ""Listen to this ad for 30 min uninterrupted music"" but it's a lie ðŸ¥²",NEGATIVE
It's really good I've got premium but I need to use the genre feature in the liked songs. My genre sorting feature does not work for Android Google Pixel and I would like it to be fixed please and thank you thanks,NEGATIVE
Love it works great in my car.,POSITIVE
Excellent music recommendations,POSITIVE
"Only 6 skips per hour, it shuffles every playlist you listen to, as every 1-2 song, expensive subscription, cant listen to something in repeat. This is my experience in the first 20 minutes of spotify. In PC or PS4 all of these are different in a better way (excluding subscription cost). Aren't spotify ashamed?",NEGATIVE
Not even YouTube has 5 ads in a row,NEGATIVE
This App is Trash I listen to Music every day and it says Something went wrong and it keeps saying that this App is Trash don't use this app also it doesn't have any songs from Soundcloud also if I have Two accounts they both don't work,NEGATIVE

Always great .... been with them from the start.,POSITIVE
Notification bar glitches.,NEGATIVE
"I love the app but there's alot more music that could be out on there, like ""ballout"" by (juice wrld) lol but yeah all in all the app is great",POSITIVE
"Bad at sticking to a soundtrack, keeps splicing other music in or just going off on tangents. Interface is to simplified, can't tell if I've got a setting wrong, but it should be the most straightforward thing to play the songs contained within a single soundtrack so there shouldn't be room for user error here.",NEGATIVE
Yo Spotify explain to me why every time I play the JRE podcast the app closes. But if I play anything else never happens. I will change my three stars back to five stars if someone can explain this. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled updated restarted my phone the whole nine yards.,NEGATIVE
Used this since 2017 and it gets used every single day Live the podcasts and the ability to just go anywhere Premium is deffinetly worth the price based on useage,POSITIVE
My Downloads disappear after I re-open the app and downloads again,NEGATIVE
This app is great until it starts constantly skipping songs on it's own every 15-30 seconds. Then it is wildly frustrating.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify. I can stream all of foreign language classes.,POSITIVE
Nice all the music I like to hear non stop,POSITIVE
I miss when they used to let you play the song before adding it to a playlist :\,NEGATIVE

Love this app for all my music!,POSITIVE
Love it always playing my jams every morning when I awake thank you spotify,POSITIVE
Cant stop app without restarting my android phone. Need an easier option.,NEGATIVE
"Terrible sound quality, noticably worse than any other streaming service I've used. I just switched over to the premium service from Amazon Music and this is a HUGE drop-off in sound quality, songs regularly skip and stutter even with a high quality Internet connection. I'm shocked at how poor the sound quality is, and I'm baffled by why this is a popular app.",NEGATIVE
You can remember the songs from the lyrics that are written. Such a great app of songs.,POSITIVE
I love Spotify! ðŸ˜ It's the only one I use.,POSITIVE
Spotify is very easy to use It's one of the best music apps out their if not best.,POSITIVE
Great variety of music and Podcast.,POSITIVE
It's either my phone is slow but it's always a drag to change from one album to the next meaning the search engin is slow.. otherwise I'm happy!,NEGATIVE
Nice choice of music.,POSITIVE
This app is a disaster now. Constant crashes and bugs. It will refuse to play downloaded tracks while offline. Or even bring up track listings. I don't know what I pay so much for this service for when it just seems to get worse with each passing month.,NEGATIVE
There are others out there but I always go back to Spotify.,NEGATIVE
It's better than a car radio.,POSITIVE
best music streaming app in history,POSITIVE
"Not happy, I can't play my music my way, unless I purchase your pay app.",NEGATIVE
I love your stories I'm literally addicted to them... It brings me back to my childhood when I use to watch Are You Afraid of the Dark and when I use to read Goosebumps book. I appreciate this podcast â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"I am updating from 3 years ago. In the last week I have lost my entire library which consisted of $4,000 songs. I just removed the app and put it in again and still no library. The first page is there with recent plays and podcasts, etc. What is going on? I see a lot of not so good reviews when Spotify used to have wonderful reviews. I sometimes use Bluetooth and there's no library for me to play. Fix this bug.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, best in business. The layout and looks are fresh and modern. Loving it",POSITIVE
Horrible app after the newest update would not recommend!!! Downloading a different app and deleting Spotify immediately!!,NEGATIVE
I find nothing wrong with the app except that it does not tell me when there are updates,NEGATIVE
Loved the app before I started to get ads. I can't skip to the next song until the current song is over because a screen saying the feature is premium. I'd rather get an ad than wait. And now I can't even select a SPECIFIC song from a playlist until I play that playlist and wait for the song I want to play. It's ridiculous how after your money this app is. PC version is better so far.,NEGATIVE
Plays Commercials but then don't play music on my tablet. Iv removed n reinstalled still same.. Update now don't play on my tone.. good by spotify,NEGATIVE
Great station I love this app you can choose your own music and play all day long,POSITIVE

By far the best app for listening to music and podcasts. I just LOVE it... Really easy to use itâ€˜s unlimited features.,POSITIVE
"Decent selection of music, but borderline unusable due to frequency of ads that are SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the music. No one needs that jarring experience.",NEGATIVE
One of the best music player but I don't like the sound quality,NEGATIVE
App continuosly quits and and malfunctions. I used to recommend it to everyone. Now I have decided to stop using the app because of its issues.,NEGATIVE
"Exceptional app, I really enjoy it because is easy to use.",POSITIVE
Easy listening with all of the Artists you can think. Search for an no matter how far back and you are there with the Artist.,POSITIVE
It is a great app. I just recommend that if you are listening to songs that if you hear ads playing restart the app then you don't get ads. Have a good rest of your day.ðŸ˜€,POSITIVE
"I like the app but I has many bugs, these days there is a new bug that doesn't show me online and I can't download any songs Or play any song that I haven't downloaded. It's getting very annoying because it's the fourth straight day of that problem.",NEGATIVE
"Lovely music app to use. It constantly gives me fresh music to listen to based on my likes, unlike apple music which keep playing the same Ole music that I constantly skip and suggestng music that I disliked. Thumbs-up to spotify.",POSITIVE
good collection of song but there are a lot of ads. Please remove ads.,NEGATIVE
Basically every song ever made ðŸ˜‚,POSITIVE
Time has come to uninstall Spotify like Jiosaavan because of ads.,NEGATIVE
It automatically stops the songs without any problem I have go again to app to play songs that frustrates to use this app it's easy to use Jio savanna instead of it,NEGATIVE
Well actually I have becomed my self as a premium user and now I can enjoy it.,POSITIVE
I'm very happy with the app nd appreciate it â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"This app is trash now, crashes constantly",NEGATIVE
"I'm one of the seven people who actually listens to the daily mix feature, and I like it because it's a good blend of songs and allows me to discover new music. However, over the past few months that feature has gone to garbage. There's no variety anymore, because it plays the EXACT same songs every single day. This feature is boring now. I have to resort now to enhancing my playlists, but it's really not the same. The rest of the app is great, but can you please fix this issue?",POSITIVE
"Used to be good, since the UI chamges it sucks.",NEGATIVE
Not really a fan of the app constantly trying to run and play songs without my permission. Im on the samsung s20 and the app will just open up and start doing its thing randomly. Yeah no thanks,POSITIVE
"I want to stop the default shuffle on EVERY playlist EVERY time. UGH, UGH, UGH Also why is it so hard to clear the queue? Do it one at a time? Here's an idea, listen to your customers.",NEGATIVE
"Hello Spotify, why have songs not been available anymore?? Its kinda your purpose to let people listen music. It makes me feel like i couldve just downloaded the songs one by one to my phone instead of paying Spotify for convenience and fun",NEGATIVE
I love all the songs and the app is surprisingly fast on my 6 year old phone. And it rickrolled me!,POSITIVE
Nice to listen to music. And you can follow your friends,POSITIVE
It's great but could use more playlist must not always be shullfed,NEGATIVE
"I've been a Premium subscriber for years. I love Spotify and have had minimal complaints in this time. The recent update to the app is a huge disappointment. It constantly crashes, skips songs or goes back to the beginning of the song. Please address this quickly! I want to go back to my 5 star app review and not cancel my subscription since I have years of liked songs and playlists saved.",NEGATIVE
Good apps in music!,POSITIVE
"Decent. The algorithms for making daily mixes can be super repetitive, even when you try to like or move liked songs into your own playlist. There really should be a dislike button instead of a ""hide song from the playlist "" function because that song will later show up in another playlist. User interface is nice and easy to use.",NEGATIVE
"Since the May 16th update, have not been able to play any music on my phone. Re installed and all my playlist are gone. Can't even search for a song, it won't play. Very upset. And her we are again with another update that did NOTHING to fix the issue. Update a month later and still not able to play any playlist. Goodbye spotify, thanks for that lovely update that took everything away.",NEGATIVE
I'm very happy with Spotify. Doesn't take a lot of data storage.,POSITIVE
It's ok but the ads every 30 min without premium kind of suck and should be moved to every 40 to an hour but other than that it's very good,POSITIVE
ads are annoying ... a lot,NEGATIVE
This music app use to be better. The random song play function plays the same songs over and over. Bring the old Spotify back!!,NEGATIVE
It was good but there was a lot of ads.this had a lot of songs which I really enjoyed and the ads were coming like more than one ad.,POSITIVE
I love this app because it has lyrics ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
It's amazing music platform I love it so much,POSITIVE
"Spotify is a great music app for finding newly released music to add to your library. What a fantastic selection, good vibes from Spotify. â¤ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰âœŒ",POSITIVE
i hate how many times i have update it. like I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO MUSICCCCCC,NEGATIVE

You can only skip 3 songs ever hour,NEGATIVE
Great service I always enjoy it can pick out exactly what I want to listen to you should get it,POSITIVE
Much improved over the last 2 yrs. Very good app.,POSITIVE
"Recent updates have made the list of liked songs to disappear. New songs can't be visibly added to the list. If I go under an individual song I can see that it is liked, yet no songs appear in the playlist. It is possible to activate the list through Google Assistant. Sometimes when you press play on a podcast, nothing happens, and then you ha e to restart the app to get it to work. Edit: pressing play on a new podcast no longer works at all.",NEGATIVE
Perfect app vert less ads,NEGATIVE
"I love being able to make my own Playlists and listen to my favorite music. Amazing ui interface, and easy to navigate with a plethora of options.",POSITIVE
I love Spotify they play anything I want to listen 3,POSITIVE
Great UI and good Playlists,POSITIVE
If you have premium this app is so cool and you can find most songs in good quality. It also recommends a lot of really good songs for me!,POSITIVE
"Absolute buggy mess. Not only does it pause whatever I'm listening to every few minutes, the play button is straight up broken. It plays when you press it, but it's impossible to pause, let alone scrub through the song or podcast. No amount of reinstalling the app or restarting my phone has been able to fix this. The exclusive content isn't worth the headache.",NEGATIVE
Wonderful & Easily accessible. All songs are available in one place.,POSITIVE
Love my Spotify music!,POSITIVE
Great app and friendly user,POSITIVE
Simply amazing simply amazing best app ever,POSITIVE
It is so much better than SoundCloud. I just wish the 3rd party DJ controller functions were back.,POSITIVE

Fastest service deliverer site,POSITIVE
I can't able to buy premium membership for all plan it show sorry you're no eligible for this plan please solve this problem,NEGATIVE

"I am trying to login to my account with my phone number but it is taking ages to get the ""vacation code or something"" and am unable to login [and the ads are annoying]",NEGATIVE
"There usually some type of issue going on. Restarting the app, and restarting the phone, doesn't always work. Maybe it's just me but I've had better luck with other apps with their algorithm for recommending me bands/songs.",NEGATIVE
I hate advertise please revome advertise from this appðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Brilliant I have music all day. Either through the TV or earphones wouldn't be without it,POSITIVE
"Hello. Im experiencing an issue where when I play any songs, it will only play for a few seconds and then pause. Afterwards the apps will freeze and im unable to load any playlist afterwards.

"Honestly it is a nice app but why is it always adding songs to my playlists this ""we added"" is so annoying idc what you added I only want to listen to my songs and not your stupid adds also it just autoplays these added songs althought I turned it off. If this won't go away I'll just switch back to youtube music/youtube because even youtube only have double ads and you have 3 ads in a row.",NEGATIVE

I love Spotify. You can listen to any music(song) you want!!! I love it â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸŽ¶âœ¨,POSITIVE
I hate it now that you updated it in a negative way now I can't even play any song I want to cause it only allows me to play with premium or I'll have to wait 6hours to play another song So plz can you just put it back to normal To wher you can play as many song as you want.,NEGATIVE
"I am a paying customer have been for a bit... over the last month, are crazy amount of song will not play anymore... either zero sound or will just not play.. thinking maybe it was the device I signed into a different device and sure enough same issue... it's quiet disappointing.. the app is updated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled..... and still... doesn't work.. can this be looked into... seeing as I drive for my job.. it would be nice to have this issue resolved.",NEGATIVE
"The app was good for the past 4 days but when i opened the app and try to play my fav songs,i started to wonder why it isn't playing the full song but now i i know...I had to play the shuffle songs which is kinda annoying since i only get 6 skips ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»...This app really is RESTRICTING.",NEGATIVE

THE BEST MUSIC APP EVER! I WOULD GIVE IT INFINITE STARS!!!!,POSITIVE
Keeping shutting down since changed from S21 to S22. Plays for a while then stops,NEGATIVE
I have been with Spotify since they begin I enjoy the music selection I enjoy the idea if I can't afford the membership at least I still got a way of listening to the music,POSITIVE
"I use this almost 100% for podcasts, even a podcast playlist which is awesome. Searching podcasts buy title or subject or topic and making customized playlists is a great feature.I do appreciate that your downloads don't take how much room and then I can use the Spotify all the time even when I'm offline. Also when I got a new phone it loaded my Spotify favorites history everything perfectly, thanks",POSITIVE
"The only issue I have is that you gotta have data to play music, other than that it's really cool",NEGATIVE
Great app and all but when I play music after it's done an advertisement pops up and after then says enjoy your 30mins of no ads ... Five mins later an ad pops up and after it's done it says the same,NEGATIVE
"Guys. I've been using Spotify from so many years. After updating to Android 12 with oxygen OS 12 on OnePlus 8t, the audio quality is very poor. I was listening to a post malone song before I hit restart for updating to Android 12 and after fishing the update I went back to Spotify and played the same song and it was distorting and the quality was so bad. I've tried other apps too like apple music and tidal and they don't have this issue. Please fix this or else I won't buy yearly premium again.",NEGATIVE
"Very nice app but it need more song's of k-pop teams and need to remove ads ""For one's is new in this app It is a nice app",POSITIVE
Very good app. But i pay for Spotify premium and podcasts tend to run their own ads on the show. Spotify need to find a way of stopping that for premium users. Or cutting it out of our podcasts.,NEGATIVE
"Was amazing until my phone updated. Now it doesn't do anything on mobile at all. My liked tracks just shows ""something went wrong try again"", my daily mixes and playlists are empty, search results never even show up....this is the only app that doesn't work on my phone since the update, please fix it.

Not very good there are so many interuptions in listening,NEGATIVE
I love this app. The only problem is there no way to download songs. The whole reason I wanted a music is to listen on the road if going on long trip. But i cant listen offline. And i am not going $120 a year to listen offline! Plz fix this. This app is my favorite to navigate. Plz read this.,POSITIVE
Very fast and amazing,POSITIVE
Best music streaming platform . Hands down,NEGATIVE
IIII HATE THIS APP PLEASE CLOSE THISS RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SKIP OR NEXT THE SONG AND SO MANY FREAKING ADS I HATE THIS APP ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
Best app for listening music we can find any song on this great app I use only this app,NEGATIVE
"Notifications are not dismissed when the app is closed on Android 12. When you close the app, the static notification that allows you to navigate your current album/playlist should be dismissed. This prevents accidentally starting music via the notification, which can be VERY annoying and disruptive. And no, I shouldn't have to manually dismiss the notification every time I close Spotify. When I close an app, it should be obvious that I don't want to use that app anymore.",NEGATIVE
What the hell happened to Spotify? With the new update you can't even play a playlist. It plays in a random order. You click on a song in the playlist it plays a preview from a random spot in the song. What the hell is this apple music? And listening to music on here is like Pandora now. It plays stations instead of the actual song. You can't even rewind anymore. What the hell spotify?!,NEGATIVE
"One of the best apps on my phone, so easy to use and garante has something for everyone to enjoy. I simply love spotify â™¥ï¸",POSITIVE
"Great music App and sharing platform. Menus/ choices are a not intuitively placed requiring you to explore but, works well.",POSITIVE
"Music is great, but Spotify keeps asking for Bluetooth access which I already gave and now the play button moved to the left which is an odd choice. Maybe a bug?",NEGATIVE

Good but ads are problem,NEGATIVE
Very good and needs improvement. It is not that user friendly !,NEGATIVE

Not able to buy premium through the app or browser.,NEGATIVE
"One of the best music streaming apps but the only problem is that it stops playing music after a couple of minutes, then I have to open the app again",NEGATIVE
Bro it's about commercials So many commercials More than YouTube and very long commercials It's make me piss me off,NEGATIVE
This is because Spotify keeps forcefully adding songs to my playlist that I don't want and limits my skips to 6 even though I don't want those songs . Please remove your recommendations as they aren't needed. Thank you,NEGATIVE
"Today, one of my family members on premium family which was already in use, stopped working. Whe i logged in, that family member was gone from the list of members. Now i cant add any new mebers either. The link does not work. Also, i cannot log a support request, there are only pre-defined problems listed, which does not have my problem listed. I cannot get my problem resolved, so i will cancel my subscription tomorrow.",NEGATIVE
Yeah it's fine when it works properly shame that's a rare occasion,POSITIVE
It won't support mobile payment. even there is enough balance + taxes needed,NEGATIVE
Simply outstanding collection of song,POSITIVE
I rate this a 1 because I want to listen to the music even after I'm on another site but what it does is it plays for a little bit and then automatically stops and the tab in the notification bar disappears it has not happened once but multiple times!!,NEGATIVE
"For the free spotify, theres lack of abilities. I mean at least when we make playlist play the songs thats are IN the playlist and not suggested.",NEGATIVE

This is an nice app for taking musices fun (and happyness).,POSITIVE
This app is the best app to listen music ðŸŽ¶ But we cant listen music ofline This is a very bad fault .we need to pay to listen songs ofline.,NEGATIVE
Useless waste of money. I downloaded this app specifically for podcasts and the obvious bias throughout the company made sure I won't be using this company again. There are major issues with programs from a specific side of the spectrum and it's becoming more and more obvious. If you're a bigot then this is the app for you,NEGATIVE
It is best app to hear music.,POSITIVE
"Because of so many advertisement I am uninstall this application, worst app . You are loosing number of users because of stupid advertisement. Should think about it .",NEGATIVE
"Best that has happened to me, now I can go anywhere and have my favorite songsðŸ–’",POSITIVE
Top class experience not minding the advertisement,NEGATIVE
Why did you guys remove the song preview when making a playlist?,NEGATIVE
"Used it for years, great app with everything you need.",POSITIVE
"Good music but too much advertising (30 sec)every after a song, and a bad laoding.",NEGATIVE

Wonderful when it's working hate it when i have to actually use the appon the phone,POSITIVE
"I've been using a 6GB RAM phone. But sometime Spotify takes a lot of time to load a song. I update the app as soon as I see update notification. I'm a premium user. I love Spotify, It's my only source of music. It's an amazing app. But if just Spotify resolve this issue, it would be 5 stars.",POSITIVE
It is a very amazing app wich makes it possible to listen to all of your favorite songs with out having problems,POSITIVE
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that,POSITIVE
This app is really amazing to listening a song ðŸ˜ƒ,POSITIVE
"Terribly optimised for android. The music skips randomly, the now playing bar dissapears, and playlists randomly undowload themselves",NEGATIVE
Add skips and play song automatic,NEGATIVE

Love it all just not the ads,POSITIVE
It keeps playing suggested songs even when i turned it off this app is so bad,NEGATIVE
Unbelievable but super I like very much I impressed thanks lot,POSITIVE
The app is just perfect.,POSITIVE
"Used to be incredible, but the so called enhancements have made it almost unusable. Playback suddenly stops without warning, the app crashes repeatedly and its now impossible to refresh playing from liked songs or playlists. I really hope this gets fixed otherwise I'll have to look at alternatives.",NEGATIVE
"As a music app definitely serves its purpose, great algorithm on preference and I love the offline play. Main reason I subscribe, you get a discount if you pay for full year which most music apps don't offer. Only draw back, doesn't offer details on tracks eg production date, producers, and also no mixed content",POSITIVE
"Please, how do I turn the shuffle off? Is annoying. I don't need the shuffle thing",NEGATIVE
It's too complicated to understand,NEGATIVE
High quality songs and lyrics,POSITIVE
Ita good but the ads are annoying and long,NEGATIVE
I was going to give you 5 Stars but In Spotify it would play one song and then starts playing like 3 to 5 Ads that are 30secs each and then it won't play the song that was going to play pls fix that.,NEGATIVE
Kindly remove shuffle option from my Spotify I hate it very bad,NEGATIVE
"Needs more sorting options. So easy to add, why not?",NEGATIVE
-1 star due to excessive number of ads,NEGATIVE
"Ads every 5 minutes, just like old school Doordarshan. ðŸ˜‚ So I finally paid for Premium. It has the best collection of songs across many applications I've used.",POSITIVE
"Very good music app, I recommend to everyone who enjoys good music",POSITIVE
It's a great app but I don't like how u add songs to playlists and sometimes I don't like the songs so that's why I gave 4 stars but apart from that it's an amazing app with different types of songs!,POSITIVE
Got the new update and now the app is trash. Never works right. Just freezes up and it's a waste of money. Would like a refund for my subscription,NEGATIVE
love this app totally but the ads r just so weird n irritating,NEGATIVE
"Personally, the latest update is one of the strangest updates ever in history of bad updates ever in companies. How are you gonna force non-premium users to use shuffle all the time? That's stupid. I don't want to have to listen to multiple other songs that don't even go with the song I'm trying to play. they ruined playlists with this update. c o p o r a t e g r e e d",NEGATIVE
Having trouble finding a couple of albums otherwise great how do you like my playlist,POSITIVE
There does not need to be an ad after every 3 songs ok. Also only 6 skips per hour is annoying,NEGATIVE
Super good music and really easy to figure out if u just started to use it is recommend,POSITIVE
Best app for songs,POSITIVE
"Premium user. Every update the bugs get worse and worse. I know bugs are bound to happen but now the app crashes constantly. The sleep timer on podcasts is broken and will not aways work. As in I have set the sleep timer set and I wake up with a podcast playing. It's an amazing app when it works well but I can't go a day after this update without a frustrating bug. The last updates yielded bugs once a week, what did you guys do with the last update that makes the app terrible?",NEGATIVE
I don't want they added song and extra song in my fav songs and actually in my playlist they so many added and i have 2 song in that playlist I love the songs but when i press the song will be other bc of ur added i wish spotify see this and remove that and pls if i play the song will play until the end of the song not u just press and song a bit and done,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify!! I feel like it's very diverse with its music but sometimes the ads just get a annoying sometimes,NEGATIVE
"It frequently crashes, they don't want you to listen, but only subscribe with payment. Annoying popups and adverts. They pay artists almost nothing. And they invest in the terminators that will one day kill us all.",NEGATIVE
I use this app evey day the only downside is the ads,NEGATIVE
Adverts a lot less intrusive than other platforms,NEGATIVE
"Needs to give you an option to ditch podcasts - or any content someone might not be interested in. I don't need a good portion of the app showing me things I'll never use. I also find navigation more difficult than necessary. Digging into an artist, album, genre, easily finding last played songs, all opaque and cumbersome to accomplish.",NEGATIVE
"Even after upgrading to premium, I'm unable to use Canvas feature... There's no such option as ""Canvas"" in the setting. Please solve this issue, one of my friend is also facing the same in Android version. Feels like Spotify doesn't give a f about us and only taking care of iPhone users.",NEGATIVE
"There is no option to find the hidden songs. I am not talking about "" show unplayable songs "" option . There is no spesific location or an option to find the songs if you do not remember the playlist or the song ! Rather than that this is a very much entertaining app â¤ï¸ðŸ‘Œ",POSITIVE
After update not working why?,NEGATIVE
Sound quality is great...,POSITIVE
"Love this app, easy to use, best for music",POSITIVE
When I hear my favorite music it makes me calm Nice app,POSITIVE
This app is a piece of junk the only thing it's good for is listening to songs on your Xbox One or computer literally it will play songs that aren't even in your playlist when you're on your phone it is literally like forcing you to get premium this app is trash on your phone but pretty good on every other platform.,NEGATIVE
Amazing music platform,POSITIVE
Excellent app sound quality is very amazing ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Sometimes my music goes off and sometimes it doesn't give me the right song,NEGATIVE
"STOP ADDING SONGS TO MY PLAYLIST! I HATE IT! IF YOU STOP DOING THAT, ILL GIVE YPU 4 STARS! GOD.",NEGATIVE
"Let's be honest your advertisements are ridiculous as everyone knows, and that's fine to have 4 ads interrupting my day but is it also necessary to happen once I run out or skips...so surprise another 3 adsðŸ˜‘",NEGATIVE
More ads than options. Keeps clinching so my podcasts close after a few minutes of playing,NEGATIVE
"This app sucks DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ALSO they have this thing where if u like a song and put it in liked songs it will play other songs and u can't do anything about it because it hides the songs in ur playlist.",NEGATIVE
"I hate the fact that when I am searching for a song, it comes out as a playlist. And the playlist is on compulsory shuffle! I end up not listening to my chosen song first/at all. It doesn't make sense at all. It inhibits my satisfaction ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
There is to many ads and you can't play the specific song you want EVEN AFTER WE'RE FORCED TO WATCH ADS! if we're forced to watch an ad Spotify can play the song I search for or pay us to watch your ads #PayThePeople #BoycottSpotify,NEGATIVE
You guys ruined Spotify. Its awful and not what it used to be. So sad to see another American freedom taken away. Time to go back to pandora.,NEGATIVE
Luv their music selection I need vintage music works like a good marriage.,POSITIVE
It's a good app if you want to listen to music and have 4 adds after every 2 songs,POSITIVE
"Since this afternoon, my app no longer shows media controls, doesn't indicate the currently playing song and doesn't show in notifications or my android 12 lock screen. Although it worked fine this morning. Could there be a conflict with my Android Auto?ðŸ˜’ðŸ™„",NEGATIVE
"Awesome way to hear the music I want to hear. The app is simple to use, straight forward, and has a great variety of artist. I have yet to be disappointed.",POSITIVE
Fresh music easy to access it fantastic thanks to the developer of this platform for great work he has provided,POSITIVE
very good application... the quality and variety of music is spectacular.,POSITIVE
The best music streaming services,POSITIVE
Best country music this side of the moon!,POSITIVE
Nice song play low net smoothly,POSITIVE
"I have had this for years, I love it and I can't complain, good updates and everything meets my needs, love that it is free and the subscription is nicer, but love that there is a option",POSITIVE
the new updates to the app have become increasingly frustrating to use,NEGATIVE
"I got 1 month premium, now when I create a playlist and add a song to the playlist through search feature app crashes and restarts on it's own and the new playlist gets deleted on it's own please fix it",NEGATIVE
Great music platform. Premium is most certainly worth it.,POSITIVE
Spotify music is a good way to relax and enjoy good music from various Artist,POSITIVE
Very easy and fun but ads come a bit too much,NEGATIVE
Very good collections.,POSITIVE
If you want to enjoying the music so this app is best for you you can see all music of world in this app i like this app Thank you Spotify,POSITIVE
A1 song app ever seen it it's like gajab amazing.......â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Spotify has become my go-to music platform for a while now. Really appreciate the work that goes into this app. I got premium and spent 20k minutes last year listening to music on here ðŸ˜…. I have one genuine feature request - blocking podcasts / removing them from suggestions on the home screen. Love you guys!,POSITIVE
"App is good and i love the sound quality. One problem i faced is, i changed phone and everything went boom!!! Can't play my playlists, can't play the downloaded songs...app kept crashing...tried everything to get it back but it was hopeless. Last i deleted all my playlists, reinstall app and it works fine again!",POSITIVE
Love this app so much I can chose any song I want,POSITIVE
Amazing and super easy to use!!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Sometimes lags when out and about. And it's great way to accessing music, and creating Playlist like back in the day.",POSITIVE
4 30 second ads for skipping one song? My 5 star just went to 2.,NEGATIVE
"App is updated, have restarted my phone, but keeps force closing. Please fix",NEGATIVE
I've only had this app for a little while but so far I really love it. I am able to hook up with my Bluetooth speaker and take it with me from room to room while I'm cleaning and it doesn't disturb my husband while he is watching T.V. I am not very good with technology and this app is very easy to use.,POSITIVE
"For what it's worth, I love it. But you will never find another app that you get a month free premium for $9.99 unless we're talking about Pandora (looking at you). Spotify is awesome cos they have their own family plan and each playlist is always curated to you",POSITIVE
"The app is good, the only problem I have is all the adds, and there are a few songs that I can't find on here, it's almost like they never existed, but so far I love all the songs I've found!",POSITIVE
"I use it all the time, paid sub. It would be dope if ppl could comment on your playlist",NEGATIVE
Why even add the playlist feature if you arn't gonna play the songs I added? ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,NEGATIVE
can you guys please add more skips and make it easier to replay songs like a replaying feature.,NEGATIVE
"Exactly what I needed, awesome stuff.",POSITIVE
Lot less ads than the other companies,NEGATIVE
Stop asking me to turn on Bluetooth and maybe I'll up this rating. I don't need a pop up every time I open an app I pay $10 a month for.,NEGATIVE
"After the most recent update, the widget on my slide down bar stops working after I've had it paused for a couple of minutes. I have to manually go back into the app itself and press play on the song.",NEGATIVE
"""Watch this commercial you'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted play"". I DID watch the commercial! about 10 minutes later, ANOTHER commercialðŸ˜³!!! I DIDN'T get 30 minutes of interrupted play.!!! What made my experience at Spotify unpleasant, song list with songs you wanted or not and when they add songs to my list it's usually people I never even heard of!!!ðŸ¤¬ I'm going to check out other music apps. I don't like playing my music and then hearing music I don't like that was chosen by Spotify!!! ðŸ˜•",NEGATIVE
Superb selection of music and podcasts.,POSITIVE
Excellent quality off sound and music genres.,POSITIVE
STILL the best music app I have ever had!,POSITIVE
"My god, if you are to use any version use the computer version, this will add random songs to your playlist, and give you limited skips so you can't go through them. The ads they also give you are so much more annoying, you cant even close the tab they open, and the only way to avoid these things is pay for premium Would not recommend to anyone, use the computer version if you really want spotify, this is a blatant cash grab.",NEGATIVE
Enchanting all music languages under one roof,POSITIVE
You took away the ability to watch video podcasts on my TV. This is literally the reason I have a paid subscription.,NEGATIVE
Sometime network issue otherwise amazing,POSITIVE
Cannot live without my Spotify!!!!,NEGATIVE
Great apps for music and podcast lovers for all generations! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE

It's good I love it but when I add songs to a playlist it randomly adds some songs. If you could make that stop thanks but if you can't sorry for wasting your time.,POSITIVE
"Wonky with sd card, no easy way to manage downloads or see how many songs you have downloaded, no good way to true shuffle through all your songs",NEGATIVE
I love the app. Been using it for many years,POSITIVE
Easy and useful,POSITIVE
Incredible app but the group sessions work better before when you could scan to connect.,NEGATIVE
"Buggy. Put a podcast into a playlist. Download pod. Play playlist. Remove pod from playlist and from downloads. Play playlist and the ""removed"" pod still plays. Also keeps saying there is no internet when every other app on my phone connects fine. I have regularly encountered this problem for years on 3 different phones.",NEGATIVE
I was stuck on pandora for a while but I am glad I switched love it,POSITIVE
"I used to love this app because I could choose which songs that I wanted to listen to in my playlist. Now, I'm forced to listen to them all just to get to the song I want to hear. You have ruined this app Spotify, congratulations, now, I will never use this app again.",NEGATIVE
"Great app, just wish would allow a like or dislike on recommended songs so the same ones don't keep reappearing.",NEGATIVE
I already mentioned the incorrect names of some songs or the timing they are being played at..too fast or too slow but no one has made the proper corrections or even acknowledge my inputs,NEGATIVE
"Started using Spotify as a student at a discount and now done studying, still use everydayðŸ¥³ Spotify makes my morning routine so much better with great music and suggestions. Thank you Spotify ðŸ¥°",POSITIVE
I love Spotify I recommend it to anyone,POSITIVE
Way better then xm. And I can always deal with ads at a free price,POSITIVE

"Good, although whats with the downloaded playlists not working when youre offline, so whats the point in downloading them??",POSITIVE
Some good old and not too old music. Nice blend of world music.,POSITIVE
Spotify is a great music app. I've discovered a lot of really amazing artists on the platform. The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because I've been trying to subscribe to premium with my Samsung phone but I can't seem to select a payment method. Is there anywhere I can resolve this?,NEGATIVE
"Smooth, has what I want and doesn't cost too much. By far my favorite music app. However, it would be nice to join the rest of the world with Hifi quality. I have to pay for Tidal on the side to get the most out of my system.",POSITIVE
"The app keeps crashing, keeps stopping and pausing for no apparent reason. I have this app for one exclusive podcast, and the cost-benefit ratio between enjoyment and frustration is tipping very seriously in the wrong direction.",NEGATIVE
Well sometimes you want lyrics on every song it is not that way always,NEGATIVE
Great selection and great music.,POSITIVE
"Spotify is a very good App, has archive of genre",POSITIVE
Playlists are being rearranged at the speed of light- this is clearly a bug and reinstalling did not work to fix it,NEGATIVE
I dont want half an hour of ads for 1 song you are a joke and this is why people will continue to find ways around your joke of an app,NEGATIVE
Can find good music on here,POSITIVE
Spotify is a great app you get to listen to your different songs it got a lot of songs around the world your favorite songs too get it ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Fantastic app I've never searched for a song that couldn't be found Spotify has everything I've ever looked for and then some love not having the commercials and a big library of songs never ending wonderful entertainment,POSITIVE
"Music quality, volume normalization, playlists, and ease and versatility of streaming on different devices are all great. Group sessions could use work. Music recommendations aren't as advanced as Spotify wants you to think - nothing will top early-Pandora's Music Genome Project. Most spotify-built playlists are worded vaguely as to what they actually are, and podcasts are shoved in your face throughout the app. Finally, 'offline mode' is straight B.S. It requires an Internet connection.",NEGATIVE
Cool now that I can finally see the lyrics (I bought premium so I can't complain about anything),POSITIVE
It's great if you have the premium subscription. Lyrics came back!!,POSITIVE
"If I want to play a specific song, it plays the whole playlist, which i find extremely annoying and it only let's me skip six songs an hour, so I'm stuck with the same playlistof songs even though i wanted tailored songs",NEGATIVE
"Sometimes during search for new it takes so much time.,",NEGATIVE
Only app worth writing a review for. Almost perfect. Now provide a visualizer for Playstation and Xbox...please.,POSITIVE
My all time favorite source of music. I've I've using Spotify since it came out and I'll never use anything else. ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Learning to love it! â¤,POSITIVE
Its ok put up with the comershals and is good free,POSITIVE
The BEST music app EVER!!!!,POSITIVE
"Won't play the song I request, just keeps playing random music.",NEGATIVE
"Wonderful, ideology ads a bit much",POSITIVE
"Deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one. Anyway. Want a consistent music app that works reliably? Look elsewhere. UI can't stay consistent and performance is always hit or miss. Don't know who, or what, group of people are running the show over at Spotify, but jesus christ, they need to go. Only reason I still use the app is because it has just about any genre and band I could ask for. If it weren't for that, I would have ditched it long ago.",NEGATIVE

Premium is simply the best way to go. Affordable and being able to download your playlists are absolutely fantastic. Great quality of life if your service is spotty,POSITIVE
"It was amazing a few weeks in, (unpaid) when I could play any song I wanted. A few later, still unpaid, I had no control. It shuffles my playlists, and I would've liked that since all my songs are good. It was an immediate uninstall when random 'recommended' songs appeared. Shuffling into a song I've never heard is unacceptable.",NEGATIVE
Music none stop all day everyday paying worth every dollar and coin.,POSITIVE

"Probably the best music app that exist. Me Personally, I think this is The Best Music App ever. My OPINION.~~",POSITIVE
Love the app. The only thing that bothers me is the new playlist system that was implemented. I can't play the songs in my playlist without it being mixed up with other songs that weren't added to the playlist. Now I usually open Spotify on my laptop because it doesn't have the annoying feature.,NEGATIVE

"Excellent catalogue of music, in any genre thought of.",POSITIVE
"Buggy and unreliable. E.g. sometimes I start Sonos music, return to the app not long after and it has no idea music is playing, so hard to stop it. A Sonos speaker that is always on the network sometimes appears in Spotify and sometimes does not (the Sonos app has no problem). Connecting to Sonos speakers is painfully slow. Often I open the app and tap one of the recently accessed items at the top of the home page and just as my finger touches it, it all moves around. And that ugly app icon...",NEGATIVE
"Unlimited Curated Playlist ability, artist information and fun to have similar artist recommendations made from my taste in music. I learn about new music from Spotify.",POSITIVE
The app is not working from the time of update. i am unable to login hope that is sorted so that I can listen to songs like always...,NEGATIVE
"Very restricting. It makes me wanna pay for premium, but I don't want to. If u don't have premium there's alot u cannot do. It is not enjoyable, it's frustrating, it makes me feel forced to pay for premium not like before there's no ""6 skips per hour"" and before u can play your liked songs in whole version. Before it was all good I've used this for a year and half now, but I'll stop now cuz it's very restricting.",NEGATIVE

Ihave enjoyed this app but i think u need to make an option to download a song,NEGATIVE
I just wish that there were less ads for someone looking for continuous music for stars.,NEGATIVE
"They seem to want to force you to go Premium? It appears that once you start a track of songs, you cannot remove the notifications and auto starting of the next song(s). Sometimes I just want to listen to a few songs and not the entire track. I haven't found that possible. So while the quality is good, the freedom of choice isn't. Uninstalling....",NEGATIVE

"I can relief from the stress and problems by listening to these beautiful songs.,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS.",POSITIVE
"I've had Spotify for a long time and it has been overall the best music app I've ever had. I would have hands down given this app 5 stars, but I'm upset with the new update. It used to have a scroll on the side but no longer has it in the new update. I have 1500+ liked songs in my Library, and I now have to scroll through 1000 songs just to get to one song I wanna listen to. Sure, I can search in my Library, but then it won't auto play all my music. -Edit- The scroll is back! 5 stars!",NEGATIVE

"Am I the only one having poor audio quality on Spotify. I have tried loud, and chosen the highest audio quality too",NEGATIVE
"Have downloaded music for when I have no service or wifi as my work requires me to be in dead zones a lot. Sadly even though it's downloaded and essentially in offline mode. I still can't use any of my downloaded music cause the app itself refuses to load. Used to not be like this but past few months to a year it has been. Let alone shuffle just shutting off or the app just doing what it feels like doing. Fix the issues. Enough apps take ""bug reports"" but do nothing. Don't be like those apps.",NEGATIVE
Easy to navigate and has all my favourite music,POSITIVE
"Nice app, But it contains too much ads.",NEGATIVE
Great music app..... lots of choice. Only listen occassionally so I don't use premium but still enjoy the control over the music and the choice. Having to listen to some commercials is absolutely fine.,POSITIVE

What's the point of being able to download music if it's just going to delete my downloaded music the day after and force me to go back online after if I want to listen to my downloaded music? Stick to Apple Music or Tidal. Spotify doesn't care for it's users.,NEGATIVE
"This app is tiring now, every playlist I make it skips song to kabza de small album I don't want to listen to. STOP IT",NEGATIVE
"this app is a really great music app , however whenever i make a playlist they always put in songs that they'll think I'll like to my playlist, and its a great thing to some people but it gets tiring hearing songs that i didnt put into my playlist, its sort of annoying.

Only but a big reason for 3 stars. I've been using for nearly 2 years and I loved it but for the past few days I've been having trouble with 'searching' songs and I thought to reinstall thinking it might work but the worst part is I can't even sign in or log in now... I miss it... It would be so kind if I can get it back. Thank you,NEGATIVE
"I really do enjoy the amount of music this app has, but I have gotten 8 ads in a row once. Would rate higher If they would chill out on the ads. You can have some but spending more time listening to ads than the music is unacceptable.",NEGATIVE

"Have the premium service and I can pick the song, the artist, or the genre of music anywhere, anytime I like with no ads or interruptions. Unlimited skips if something doesn't fit my groove. Play straight through an album, a Playlist, or go random through liked songs. Even voice commands with Google and integration with Waze are a breeze. Two thumbs up ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘",NEGATIVE
Hands down best music streaming App Nothing else comes close. I've experimented with other platforms but nothing compares. When my friends tell me that they don't use Spotify I tell them that they're absolutely crazy. The podcast options are the best too.

I am known to be a negative person but I have nothing negative to say about Spotify except for making me use 500 words to write this review. Holler?!!,POSITIVE

"Its great it's beacuse of the free trial of the premium, but the sad part is I can't shuffle the songs anymore and doesn't have a special features. Please we all want those experience especially with us music lovers, and high up our colors in these musics.",NEGATIVE
I love this app and everything it has but its been crashing way too much lately,NEGATIVE
"App crashes a lot recently, I pay but still have to listen to adds",NEGATIVE
"Not free, actually money grabbing app. Can't skip after 6 times and can't fwd.",NEGATIVE
"For some reason it always remains open in back ground. Every time I get off of a call and am hooked up to my Bluetooth in car it resumes playing music. Every time I get a new notification the bloody app is sitting open on top of my notifications. I've gone through all settings, but seems this app just wants to be in constant use. Over rides other media apps that I have playing in car and sometimes plays simultaneously to other apps. Seriously annoying. Am considering cancelling my subscription",NEGATIVE
"Great appðŸ‘ Constructive feedback: desperately needs a function for changing playback speed (American ""authors"" often speak so slowly, with long pauses between words, that their podcast can become tedious) Edit: Still bright blue adverts for bat-flu info in the app, it has come and gone already - Im sick of hearing about it. Deducted a star.",NEGATIVE
Songs skip to another one or just stop for some unknown reason...but otherwise I.love.it!!,POSITIVE
"even in the newest version(8.7.38.667), I still can't view the lyric",NEGATIVE
"You can't play songs you searched for , they play me a playlist instead of the song plus the song isn't even in the playlist ! I hidden every song on the playlist expect what the one I wanted to hear and it still won't play it and starts playing the hidden songs , this app is juts terrible , don't waste money on it .",NEGATIVE
This an excellent app to listen music. I really loved experience on this app,POSITIVE
Very expensive premium for Tajikistan((,POSITIVE
Fantastic app for music lovers,POSITIVE
It is good but too many ads I suggest you reduce the amount of ads,NEGATIVE
30 minutes of no ads of you watch this 2:30 later ads,NEGATIVE
"a bit of suggestion to spotify, could you add an on and off setting on recommend songs? it gets annoying when random musics starts playing in my playlists! if you add it I'll give a 5 star rating, thanks.",NEGATIVE
Fantastic! Lyrics perfect! Recommended!!!,POSITIVE
Without internet I listened the songs and enjoy my daily traveling,POSITIVE
Very nice app with wide selection.,POSITIVE
Great but more adds,POSITIVE
Premium is awesome and never bugs out ðŸ¤ž,POSITIVE
"Spotify was always my go to app when it comes to listening to music. I've had premium for a while but am not able to afford it anymore, wich wasn't really that bug of a problem before but now with the new update it's almost impossible to use for free. Like, making being able to listen to songs basically only for premium users?? C'mon, it's not like spotify doesn't have enough money. Don't stoop so low",NEGATIVE
I wish you could download music without prime,NEGATIVE
Too much of ads Really fed-up Getting 4 ads in one go,NEGATIVE
I have charge $5.50.I think is free but still paying,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify this a good song app,POSITIVE
Am giving 2 star because am in Nigeria and I can't even subscribe. Will be uninstalling the app soon,NEGATIVE
"The application was telling me to enter to my account,I have my account connected to my Facebook account,but it did not let me enter to my account because there was an error,I decided to connect my account with my Gmail account and when I opened my account of Spotify all my Playlists where gone, I try to ser if I could recover it on the website and nothing,it was 2 years of compilations and everything to hell, Thanks Spotify.",NEGATIVE
This very.. nice app.. for music.. and podcast.. And their are many artists.. you make own playlist.. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
The last update was fine because you had a chance to play your songs in order or not. on the phone I'm not a fan of the new update I can't even play my songs in order it's only playing shuffle when I try to listen for a new song so it goes to a different song,POSITIVE
"I wish I could rate this app more but that's definitely not happening. My experience with this app has been nightmarish considering all I wanted to do was listen to music. First, this app is about music, right? Well, in my case, the music DID NOT EVEN PLAY. It would show it was playing, but it wouldn't make any sound. I can assure you this had nothing to do with my device volume. As for the playlists, THEY NEVER EVEN LOADED. This does not have anything to do with WiFi, either.",NEGATIVE
The best app with music & radio !!! Congrats !!!,POSITIVE
Can't wait to listen to ads before the songs ðŸ¥°,NEGATIVE
"Please remove the ""smart"" shuffle to be honest it's not smart it's dumb when I click the song I want to listen it gives me a song don't want no wonder why people think SoundCloud is better your app will fail if you keep this up",NEGATIVE
Fantastic App. So far I found every track and album which I searched. Can't imagine why I did not start using Spotify earlier. Thouroughly enjoying the vast selection of music...,POSITIVE
10 times better than Pandora and YouTube combined I love Spotify,POSITIVE
I love listening music on Spotify,POSITIVE
Excellent app. All types of songs basically available here,POSITIVE
Enjoyable and excellent performance,POSITIVE
The song recommendations are good but the only issue is that at times when I have my earphones connected to my phone it would randomly start playing some song like that's really annoying if u could fix that then I'll rate it 5 stars and the ads are really annoying,NEGATIVE
Very nice but Dont Advertasment,NEGATIVE
"I can't get the app to play a playlist. I choose a playlist, shuffle and it plays one song before randomly playing songs that aren't on my playlist. It also defaults to one song when I stop listening. A year later from the above review, and the app intermittently stops playing my downloaded music. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the problem persists.",NEGATIVE
This app is really amazing and I would recommend you to try it,POSITIVE
Video playback doesn't always restart without a full app closure,NEGATIVE
It's as if I'm hearing the music at a live show and gazing gayly upon the bands I love so much.,POSITIVE
Nice app because of listening music all the time ðŸ˜ƒ,POSITIVE
"very good app, but if no membership you can't play the song you want to play",POSITIVE
Pretty good app overall can be a little slow sometimes like when I'm in the car it takes a while for songs to load when there downloaded and u have to have internet to look at the lyrics even if the song is down loaded ðŸ˜† lol,NEGATIVE
I love every genre of music that Spotify offers,POSITIVE
"Okay. Spotify often doesn't give me what I search for, and when it ""does"", it often doesn't give me what it said it would. The next tracks are similar, but not from the same artist. YouTube sticks to one artist mostly, but introduces you to knew people too, so that's better. YouTube gives you what/who you searched for. Spotify plays in the background, so that's better than YouTube or TY Music. YouTube 2 Spotify 1. YT Music is basically a poor man's version of YouTube, so no point there.",NEGATIVE
This has just become trash spotify before was better it doesnt shuffle and had no ads and it had unlimited skips unlike now the owners want money cause they think everyone can afford premium while. Other people just wants to listen to music youtube music is better than spotify my opinion but people probably hate spotify too cause of the shuffle and ads,NEGATIVE
Love this app but the ads are irritating and can't listen to my fav song offline,NEGATIVE
"Its very informative that Joe Rogan chose Spotify as their main residency for their podcast. In my own experience, Spotify is the worst app I've ever used. Everytime I have to use it I despise. It keeps crashing. I use a s21 ultra phone There is no reason I should have so many issues with this all alone.. Of jre did not switch, I wouldn't usr Spotify at all. Spotify. Just improve your UI and stop sucking",NEGATIVE
Many Punjabi songs not available on this app like sohni sohni song i search a song many times but reasult is always same .,NEGATIVE
Please try and upload correct lyrics of the songs and also the provision of translation.,NEGATIVE
"Simple, quality, clear sound Easy access to many jonneras of music at your fingertips",POSITIVE
I Likes Spotify! recommended,POSITIVE
"I create a Playlist and I can't play song from that Playlist, because Spotify plays other song than that one. Wowowow way to go guys.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best app to listen to music on.,POSITIVE
All the music you want and more....,POSITIVE
This so amazing app and mast song,POSITIVE
Expect ads everything is good,POSITIVE
Many ads irritating,NEGATIVE
I hate Spotify because with out premium u can only skip a couple times and when u search a specific song u hardly get that one without listening to other music and if u make a Playlist they add random songs and they usually suck,NEGATIVE
Pretty much only amazing if you buy a membership but reasonable price for a great product,POSITIVE
It's never letting me play my licked songs or my playlists anymore SCAM,NEGATIVE
"Spotify has given me the opportunity to listen to my fav podcast, MORBID!! I love it!!!!!!",POSITIVE
Liked it a lot . It is easy to use the app and also can be played with slow internet access. Only problem is ads but overall that's the best app among all the music playing apps. Thanks Spotify Team for it.,POSITIVE
Unless you pay for premium membership you get to listen to 2 songs then a load of adverts. The shuffle feature plays a small selection from your playlist of about 5 songs. This has improved slightly over the past month but still not great. The 30 minutes uninterrupted that you occasionally get isn't 30 minutes and on occasion has only played 3 or 4 songs. Sometimes you play a song then it just stops for no reason at all which is frustrating. I'm fast loosing faith in the ability of spotify.,NEGATIVE
Please add a feature where I can shuffle all my playlists! I will give you 5 starsâ¤,POSITIVE
You cant go into your playlist and play songs in order like you could before now you HAVE to litaen to it shuffled,NEGATIVE
Not only is it expensive it doesn't work and goes down intermittently more and more I am honestly thinking of canceling and going to a different service,NEGATIVE
App does not give me the song I want is extremely difficult to use rather opt for deezer,NEGATIVE
Easy listening experience.,POSITIVE
"After uninstalled for months I am reinstalling this app . The previous reason for unistallation was , There were issues like we can't hear we want instead of it we have to went through playlists which we usually don't like and also '' THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF HEARING "". Hopefully now there wouldn't be forceful policy to opt premium version.",NEGATIVE
I love listening to playlists made by my teenage kids.,POSITIVE
Really wonderful and useful aap,POSITIVE
You need to look wynk their have very less ads and your app are full of ads please do something,NEGATIVE
Great way to listen to all my favorites for the 90's and 2000's.,POSITIVE
Excellent service good listening,POSITIVE
I love spotify but i dont like the suggestions in my playlists that actually play.if i wanted those songs they would be there.thats a really annoying new thing going on.,NEGATIVE
Who can really fault Spotify? I use the paid version but it's very much worth it.,POSITIVE
Super Amezing great app my old song all getting nice,POSITIVE
"I don't know if this a glitch or something but when I tried to press the play button it played another song. Please fix this, also again, I don't know if this a glitch cause I'm new to this app. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
Love this! My kind of companion and the9 SC band's as well!,POSITIVE
Great app and songs. Very user friendly. Thx,POSITIVE
"this application is the best find for listening to music. however, for the last month I've been seeing the loss of features that are very important to me (like previewing songs before adding them to a playlist) for music and podcasts. plus, I can't add new podcasts to my saved ones now :c it's becoming more glitchy with each update and it's really disappointing because it's a premium version upd.: the support never helped but sent me the google form link to grade the support work...",NEGATIVE
So much music! Global reach...make magic for us...we all need it ... everyday!,POSITIVE
"Only thing, that you cannot download songs in free version. The makers can limit the downloads to 40-50 so that one can listen even if he is out of network",NEGATIVE
Sonmany add after every song Hope so they will understand problem by the way I am enjoying Spotify a lot Thank you ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Pixel 6. Android 12. Cannot slide the categories under my liked playlist. Fix before my next billing cycle or I will most likely cancel my Premium service. I'm not paying for crippled software and service.,NEGATIVE
Great finding all the songs I want and ones I never knew about,POSITIVE
Best music/song app ever..i highly recommend uh,POSITIVE
i enjoy the music here.thank you spotify for the free music!!!,POSITIVE
Very nice app It is the best music +songs app â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ’ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ’•ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘l like this app,POSITIVE

Just a W app. Helps with my workout routine ðŸ’ª,NEGATIVE
Great job at finding music that I like,POSITIVE
This is a best song ðŸ‘Œ spotify,POSITIVE
"i kinda hate this app now before it was great and when the updte came in its a whole new trashbag my issue is it stops randomly and there is no skip button when a 30 or 40 second ad came in and when i create a playlist for myself random songs just came in even if i didnâ€™t added it but im still not gonna delete this app since its the only app that i can listen with but please fix it its forcing me to use premium even tough i have no money :""D",NEGATIVE
EVERYTHING you could possibly need to enjoy ANY music from anywhere! !,POSITIVE
I've had Spotify since 2014 and I used to love it but now I get all the same music over and over there's never anything new or that I enjoy. The app NEVER suggests actual new music within your specific niche. I'm seriously tired of listening to the same songs and artist over and over. They should sincerely consider whatever algorithm YouTube has going on because this sucks.,NEGATIVE
No way to see all songs by an artist. I don't deal in albums so i have no clue where one song is in 20 albums. Wont be payong for premium again.,NEGATIVE
"Am really enjoying myself with the app, is really a moving truck",POSITIVE
Best music app compared to all other apps,POSITIVE
Please increase the audio quality.,POSITIVE
"id prefer it if we had the option to search overall for a song in a folder in the library tab, but other than that i enjoy using spotify",NEGATIVE
"It's a good app but the only downside is it won't play the songs you want to listen to. Fir example if you try cklicking on a song, it won't play it, it will play a radio bassed around that song.",NEGATIVE
Thanks to you Spotify..,POSITIVE
"Auto recommended music , sounds quality sharp , bass just perfect to go along with all song.",POSITIVE
Selection of song is very easy Enjoying,POSITIVE
App sucks. It pauses when my phone screen goes off. Phone screen needs to stay on in order to keep music playing. Even the downloaded music and in offline mode. And even though I've allowed Spotify to run in the background. What is up with this ???????????????? So annoying and frustrating !!!!! ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ™„,NEGATIVE
How can you guys okay with your app..I can neither log into nor make a new account...how inappropriate. I've been trying from so long but it all gone waste. I can't enter in your app. It keep saying something went wrong. I don't know what is wrong on creating a new ID. Just something you guys.,NEGATIVE
I just loved this one... without ads non-stop musicðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
Spotify is best,POSITIVE
Amazing app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ all songs quality amazingðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Well i guess the mixes are good enough ... still prefer if i could play my favs freely tho... you know, like how it was supposed to be...! Plss bring it back plss plss plss.asdasdsdsdssd",NEGATIVE
Excellent app with out any disturbances,POSITIVE
"My podcasts keep stopping once my phone screen turns off...didn't used to do this, did it constantly today. If I'm paying for a service it should work properly. Just installed an update yesterday, but you've obviously got some more work to do...",NEGATIVE
I wanna kill my self bc of this it won't let me loop or play the song I want it never did I don't want it to shuffle pls make it a option to turn it off and on it driving me nuts bc I can't do the things I want I have actually cried over this many times bc I was so angry,NEGATIVE
"App is good. However, seems a bug. Intermittent issue observed when phone tries to go on landscape mode, Spotify fails some of the time. Pkease get it checked thoroughly.",NEGATIVE
App always freezing had to downgrade,NEGATIVE
"Try to sign up but it say my email already connected to another account. But, I cant even ""log in without password"" or reset the password, alway crash.",NEGATIVE
"I've been enjoying spotify. Since I've got spotify, the interface, the music playlist, just everything has been great. I have a google home and pairing and using it for music is seamless, It automatically syncs with all my devices. Turn off my laptop and pick right back up on my phone. I recommend even the free version is worth it. Trust me, you won't regret subscribing to Spotify.",POSITIVE
I like this but I kind of have a little bit of Doubt but I like this app because you could still listen to your music even though you turn your phone off and your off of the app you can still listen to the music so I like Spotify,POSITIVE
Wonderful there are literally all the songs in the world,POSITIVE
I've had no problems and love how you can customize the audio to a bit,POSITIVE
Why I hate Spotify is it doesn't play my favorite song it just plays a random song and when I skip it it says Slowdown you get 6 skips per,NEGATIVE
"Such a all rounder app , All at one location , Really loved it",POSITIVE
Great way to keep up with what's new or binge listen fav's.,POSITIVE
The lyrics are so good. It feels great using it.,POSITIVE
"Lit app, especially when you're either alone or with friends. I just don't like the fact that their are less ads on the when using a computer and when you use a phone their are much more ads.",NEGATIVE
Good clear music no adds love it,POSITIVE
Spotify is #1 in the world ðŸŒ.,POSITIVE
This is worst...it shows too many ads..although it shows that after one ad there won't be any ads for the next 30 minutes but if you close the app and reopen it...it will again show you ads..just here to criticize it for being so greedy for earning money by showing ads..whereas ....its primary function is to let us listen song peacefully rather it ruin our mood sometimes by showing irrelevant ads..this app literally forces you to buy their subscription,NEGATIVE
They do like music and stuff.,POSITIVE
"EVERYTIME I LOOK UP A SONG IT WILL NOT PLAY. THIS IS THE WORST APP. IT PLAYS EVERY SONG BUT THE SONG I CLICK ON. Please update and fix the problem. It has worked perfectly until now. AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, DONT PAY THE SUBSCRIPTION.",NEGATIVE
Easily the worst app experience I've ever had. Every update messing up so many things. UI still confusing and terrible. App isn't registering when I am playing a podcast or song. And randomly stops playing some times.,NEGATIVE
"I'm getting tired of all your YouTube ads back to back, and just your ads in general are way too long",NEGATIVE
Good but on my phone When Free Trial ends puts all can't do much,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever totally worth the $10 a month no annoying ads I can repeat as much as I want and I love that you can create your own private Playlist.,POSITIVE
THE GREATEST!!! Tried them all and I always come back. Great sound quality and sooooo easy to use!!!,POSITIVE
"Loved it before! but now I can't preview any of the songs in my add songs section. So I can't put anything new in my playlists. Not cool, please fix",NEGATIVE
I like the music selection and the ease of Spotify,POSITIVE
"Confusing. No play bar anymore cant pause or next or stop. The song will stop suddenly, I have to reopen the app to get the song play",NEGATIVE
Itf works But pay to change gets a star knocked off Better than radio when you just want to jam,NEGATIVE
"Great music app, good for all kinds of music.",POSITIVE
I love using this app. This is one of the only apps I need in life. You can organize playlist for different moods.,NEGATIVE
"Dismal. Cuts out, constantly having to reboot, shuffle repeats the same songs from a playlist within 2 hours when there is 100 hours of music on it. Appalling",NEGATIVE
"Terrible app. i have used this app for years to come but now I have to pay to listen and choose my songs now because my ""14 day trial"" has ended, this is just a big pay to listen app and it adds stuff fi dont want in my playlist and removed alot of stuff that you could use for free to premium users only. Old spotify was better,SoundCloud and YouTube here I come!",NEGATIVE
Nice app but ads is problem,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy Spotify it includes all my favourite podcasts.,POSITIVE
Love how it finds other songs that are in the same Era and adds them To my Playlist,POSITIVE
Spotify please can you have a chat feature??? hshshhs i wanna that!!! ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,NEGATIVE
The now playing/media control bar has started to randomly disappears after a while if the app has been backgrounded and you cant get it back unless u fc the app ðŸ‘Ž Edit: still broken ill make my own instead,NEGATIVE
It don't turn off when I go to different apps,POSITIVE
"I preferred Spotify stations where I could listen to just one artist without the app deciding to throw in a recommended artist because ""I might like them"". Also this app has a tendency to just turn itself on when I try to open apps such as Facebook or Google Maps.",NEGATIVE
"Love this app absolutely. One thing I would recommend is listing ""Hide this song"" lower in the drop down of the details. I have hit it accidentally a few times and haven't been able to recover the songs.",NEGATIVE
Spotify has all the music I need,POSITIVE
"Solid service with a huge range, good recommendations and a easy to use interface. Totally worth a monthy subscription for premium",POSITIVE
Way too many adds,NEGATIVE
I wish they can make it to where you can play a specific song by itself without playing extra songs,NEGATIVE
"GET THE EXTRA BUTTONS OFF MY SCREEN! They cover the information to the content I'm interested in! WHY? For nearly 10 years the Spotify community has been begging for an explicit only filter. If you look at Spotify's own reasoning for having explicit content in the first place it's ""to present the song the way the artist intended."" Yet they daily force edited versions into my content. And right above where I'm typing this it says that Spotify is always changing. Just not for the better huh?",NEGATIVE
"Don't know how I've managed without it, absolutely love itðŸ‘",POSITIVE
I Do Not Like This App Now Why: Because When It Updated They Made It So You Dont Chose Your Own Song To Play And You Dont Get Skip Your Song Spotify Change It Back Now,NEGATIVE
Good variety of shows.,POSITIVE
"The worst FU$%!@& app ever made its not user friendly, terrible to use i cant listen to the album I want to or the way i want to because shuffle has to be on i cant stand this app but its the only place to listen to certain artists/ podcasts its a huge pain in the @$$ i hate this app with a passion so much because its so bad i cant even deal with it to listen to DRAKE its so not worth it because of the app I just want to look at a songlist for an Album that came out can't even do that needs fix",NEGATIVE
It's so easy to access on and offline. Definetly recommend because of it being such a good app for music.,POSITIVE
Good podcast and music,POSITIVE
Does the trick! Learns what you like well.,POSITIVE
Love it I can always find what I'm looking for,POSITIVE
"I got logged out of my Spotify account and I kept logging in but it said ""Something went wrong"" can you resolve this problem?",NEGATIVE
"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I really don't see the point of not being able to choose the song you want. And in addition to this, when you search a song and click on that song, it plays a completely different song. Honestly what the hell is that. Who else agrees? Never thought I would be saying this but I'm switching to SoundCloud, SCREW YOU SPOTIFY!!!",NEGATIVE
It has all kinds of great music that I like to listen to,POSITIVE
"Wow... this app is totally amazing ðŸ·, love itâ¤ï¸ , keep up the the good work spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ½",POSITIVE
Its amazing usually but lately i go on spotify and go to library and all my music is gone same with my playlists are empty,NEGATIVE
Please add an option to shuffle all Playlists. How is it 2023 and we still can't do it?,NEGATIVE
"Don't download it, not worth it. I'll stick to it until i find something else to listen my music on, they are ruining the free version to rush users into buying premium, basically removing free services just so you buy premium. Maybe if people left even more bad reviews, they might think twice and see what they're doing wrong.",NEGATIVE
Love this app. Totally worth paying for premium,POSITIVE
What happened to the podcasts? I used to be able to select one and it would take me to the last episode I listened to. Now it just starts at the top and I have to scroll through 300 episodes to get to the one I was on. Not cool.,NEGATIVE
I love listening to my favorite songs playing in the background. I love this app that is why it deserves 5 star rating.,POSITIVE
I can't play MY PLAYLIST without playing a raido with songs I've NEVER heard before,POSITIVE
"Wish it wasn't so limited in available bands\songs, but the app itself and it's features work great.",POSITIVE
"I'm using this app for many years now and it has become one of my most used services ever. Nothing gets close to Spotify's convinience and ease of use. I couldn't live without it anymore. I espacially love the huge library of music. No other service gets close to that. And the discoverability of new music on Spotify is unmatched, too. But pls, work on the following! Pls, -fix Spotify rewind (didn't run on my old device) -release spotify HIFI in the EU! (I need high res badly) Thank you! :)",POSITIVE
"Spotify is always my go to for music. Update June 13 killed the speed. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it now takes 20+ seconds to skip or respond to any action. I hope that gets fixed soon or I'll have to shop elsewhere. Too bad, because I use it a few hours a day",NEGATIVE
I hate the amount of skips you have only 6 for every hour plus it plays songs that aren't on your playlist like fix that it gets in my nerves but overall it's a good app it's just those dumb things they need to fix,POSITIVE
I really like how it has so many choices for songs. There are many different artistes too.,POSITIVE
So far so good. Still limited by only getting to choose one music genre/ style unless you make a playlist. I want the freedom to choose as many styles/genre's and be able to listen to music my way especially when I am paying for it. Has a large selection of music but is also missing a large selection.,NEGATIVE
Amazing ðŸ‘ recommend this app with the premium feature,POSITIVE
Don't like Spotify adding random tracks to my lists,NEGATIVE
"Plss fix your app, it's hard to use, what the heck, all the songs and playlists shuffled play I can't even play the song I want because it's shuffled even though a song isn't included in the album There are also many ads Plss fix it ðŸ˜¢btw I'm not angry I just asked for a little request on spotifyðŸ¥º",NEGATIVE
It was nice hear how the new/suggested songs sounded like but now I don't have that small preview and it's really annoying,NEGATIVE
Really bad when I search up a song I di find it but it takes me through a whole Playlist and I can't skip. However when I do find the song I want I can't put it on repeat I remeber back them you could. Spotify explain,NEGATIVE
Veri slow to load up and move thru.,NEGATIVE
"I love it, spotify is amazing!",POSITIVE
THIS IS TOO BROKEN IF I CLICK THE SONG I WANT THEN WHERES THE PLAY BUTTON!? AND IT CAN CHANGE SONG WHEN IM TOUCHING THE PLAY BUTTON THIS APP IS BROKEN,NEGATIVE
Lyrics are not loading most of the time! Please fix this!,NEGATIVE
Really didn't want to use a app on my phone for music my son talked me into it he said the even have music for us fossils so yes its brilliant definitely recommend this appðŸ‘ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§,POSITIVE
"It is been terrible for the past couple of weeks I can not access the app when my network data is on and data is actively working. I have used different network data but still have the same problem. It is really frustrating, fix it thanks",NEGATIVE
"It's significant for me, I highly recommend him ... But if there are some updates on widgets, It will be more great for me ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©",POSITIVE
Updated it now playing on other devices is a problem. I can't consistently connect to my laptop. Previously I could but now it's a problem. Updat is trash,NEGATIVE
By far the Best music app love it! Still #1! Every update gets better!,POSITIVE
Great love that I can make my own Playlist easy to do for a senior person who loves old and new artists. THANKS.,POSITIVE
Great but the radio is terrible. They just play the same songs over and over. They will play the same songs from the album you just listened to as soon as radio kicks in... lame.,NEGATIVE
Still trying to get it to play more than one song without restarting.,NEGATIVE
I loaded up Picked up a bunch of Groups Within 5 minutes I was up and running Certainly not like the other app,NEGATIVE
Terrible in app experience. No playlist selection can make up for the UI.,NEGATIVE
Kind of sucks how it's only in shuffle but at the same time I think it's a good thing because you don't have to decide what plays next.,POSITIVE
"Love the app and the ease, but the thing that lets it down most is the integration with Google Assisstant. Asking it to play one track and you get a completely different one. I don't know which end has the issue but it definitely causes a lot of headaches.",POSITIVE
It's a good app i can listen what i want hehe,POSITIVE
Great as long as you can cough up 10 bucks a month,POSITIVE
App is good but now sharing in snap chat is glitchy plz fix it ðŸ˜Š,NEGATIVE
Good app but needs to have early 2000s remixes and Indi pop songs,NEGATIVE
Good starts up as soon as I get in my vehicle and very easy to switch to different albums.,POSITIVE
Its amazing! But not ALL sorts and forms of songs are available mostly the ones with top views are there not more...also stupid ads,NEGATIVE
"Best music app you can download! Has every single song/artist you like listening to, different mixes depending on your mood, and podcasts to listen to if you're not in a music mood! If I could I would give this app 10 stars, that's how amazing it is!",POSITIVE
Ok it's fine just 1 thing. Stop adding random songs to playlist just based on my music taste that I can't remove. Its annoying. I dont want them there.,NEGATIVE
"Most annoying app ever. forces you to listen to complete songs from artist you do not like. Saying slow down, you only get six skips per hour. I can understand happen to watch a commercial but to make me listen to a complete song before I can move on?",NEGATIVE
Spotify is wonderful. Premium is worth it. (Edit) Group session very rarely works and it would be great if you guys could work on that and fix any bugs. It's one of my favorite things about Spotify.,POSITIVE
"One of the best music app,to listen and discover new music.great selection and quality plus very user friendly.",POSITIVE
"Spotify please stop putting suggested songs I don't want to listen to in my playlist we only get 6 skips & no I don't want premium I just want to listen to the songs I put in my playlist in peace & now to add on to this the preview songs is no longer available making it hard useless trying to discover new songs/music, it's aggravating .",NEGATIVE
First 1 weaks very nice but 2 weaks app was log bug not change next song not use Burton's very many bugs very bad experience ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Love it best music app,POSITIVE
"Wish it would work right.. doesn't show controls (or anything) in notification bar like other apps. constant updates, never see any changes but you better update cause it'll steadily glitch if you don't. Itll lose my place or just suddenly end a podcast early.. Kinda sucks all around. This will probably get deleted like my last review",NEGATIVE
This is one of the worst apps I am forced to use. I loved Spotify and was happy to pay the $12 a month but for that I feel like I should get an app that works. One that opens and doesn't freeze every 5 seconds. It's been months now and Spotify does this thing where it doesn't show It's playing at least twice a day and the only way to fix it is to restart my phone. You should expect to lose a lot of customers over this. Update: it's even worse and doesn't play sound when it shows it's playing,NEGATIVE
Hard as hell to set up and when ever I use Bluetooth the sound automatically goes to quiet and there's no way to fix it,NEGATIVE
"9 ads just to listen music, you're gonna listen to more ads than actual music.",NEGATIVE
services are soo slow its my 8mb connection and it is taking almost 10 secs to play any song why ?,NEGATIVE
"Weâ€™re always making changes and improvements to Spotify. To make sure you donâ€™t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on.",POSITIVE
"It is impossible to shuffle play all downloaded tracks. People have been asking for this simple, highly useful feature for years. Before that it was actually possible. Apparently the folks at Spotify have never been on a road trip through the mountains or on a flight with no internet connection. In the forums, their answer is to build a playlist; this answer is condescending and unhelpful.",NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify. Gives ads, you can pay for Spotify premium tho, which is great for listening offline.",POSITIVE
Just the most amazing musical experience in and beyond the multiverse! In a nano second of time you create what used to take me months and months and months to do. God! I wish I had this tech 25 years ago! Spot-on Spotify Spot-on.,POSITIVE
"I've been using the free version and I loved this app for 2 years, but recently the ads have gotten so annoying. 1-2 ads is okay every 4-5 songs but I have gotten at least 2 ads in a row after EVERY SINGLE song and I even got 6, 30-second long ads in a row today! They also removed the preview version, so now struggle to find new songs.",NEGATIVE
Love it always manage to find what I like to listen to,POSITIVE
"Recently I can only listen to 3 or 4 songs before the skipping starts and the music quality is unbearably bad. Contacted support 3 times, they didn't even engage in trying to fix it, just no interactions in the chats the last 2 times. Will likely cancel subscription if I can't get someone to try and address this over the weekend.",NEGATIVE
"Garbage - only plays songs NOT in my playlists, even with every conceivable setting to prevent it.",NEGATIVE
Very few glitches Works 99% of the time Too expensive but best option,POSITIVE
"Without premium you only get six skips an hour. It won't let me manually change songs, so when I am on a song that I don't wanna listen to and I'm out of Skips I have to deal with it or pay for premium. This problem is only on phone. On my tablet it's the perfect music app. Unfortunately I can't play any music on it without Wi-Fi on my tablet. Spotify sucks without premium. You're already getting money from ads. Do you really need to charge me to enjoy your app?",NEGATIVE
It has a nice variety of music and podcasts but it very often stops working so I have to Uninstall then reinstall the app to get it to work again.,NEGATIVE
"Used spotify for YEARS! love the platform and will be a user for life! The yearly wrap ups of all your top songs is great and lots of Playlist variety! You can find almost any song you want, even soundtracks. 5 stars!!!",POSITIVE
Love listening to music I want to hear.,POSITIVE
Love Spotify.... I have used it for years!!!!,POSITIVE
Listening to music without any break!ðŸŽ§â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
It is really good I have made about 50 Playlist and even I'd you don't get premium you have to deal with some ads and come on a fue ads won't kill you it's better then most games nut anyway anyhow Spotify Is really good,POSITIVE
I can't listen to my music and I have to pay with is unfair and recommend do not download. I always have to listen to other music they recommend but they all suck. It's better to just hear music on youtube,NEGATIVE
Much loud ads after every song,NEGATIVE
I can't play the song itself I have to listen to the entire Playlist and even when i make my own Playlist it adds its own songs,NEGATIVE
"It's an awesome app, you can play it outside of the app even if you're device is off. But Spotify does everything in it's power to keep non-premium users from having cool features. It's really dumb to have limited skips and your playlist doesn't play in order on mobile and you can't loop your songs unless you're premium other then that it's pretty good but just a few premium features that should be regular.",POSITIVE
Making it different from other's is Podcast.... Love the app,POSITIVE
The new update is very bad.I can just hear a few seconds of my songs in my playlist,NEGATIVE
Most recent update has completely bricked the app on mobile for some reason. Please fix.,NEGATIVE
Has just about everything u can think of and easy to use,POSITIVE
Best music streaming app ever,POSITIVE
I like the app but I don't like that you have 6 skips per hour because I don't like sitting through a song that I don't like. knowing I can't skip it,NEGATIVE
I think this company is very sneaky when you want to cancel something they make it very hard you know I guess they just want you to keep paying for a service that you don't use anymore so they make it difficult for you to find where the cancel be wary of these kind of companies cuz the only thing they care about is milking you for every penny you have and when a time to get rid of these apps they make it hard,NEGATIVE
"So awesome getting music, podcasts all easily available ðŸ˜€",POSITIVE
I can find most songs. I had to reload the app not to long ago. No phone support kinda sucks,NEGATIVE
Love the free music and library,POSITIVE
I like it a lot. I pay for premium so no adds. I don't make playlists or do anything fancy. I put an album on and let it play then I pick another. I like that the app shows new music from artists you like. You have to click follow on the artist but it's no biggie. Plus it shows support for that artist. I like that it will show you concerts coming up from your followed artists. All that said for how I use it it is five stars.,POSITIVE
It is good with or without paying for premium,POSITIVE
Too many ds!! It's not a music app but an ads app now!,NEGATIVE
I am unable to login again !!!! Worst app i have ever used to login ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,NEGATIVE
Experiencing issues while searching for a song sometimes. It shows no internet connection even if i am connected to one. This is very annoying. Fix this,NEGATIVE
its a good app when im in a bad mood,POSITIVE
I use Spotify for everything but I am quite disappointed not angry it's a bit disappointed that you have to get premium to skip as much as you want and I'm also not big fan when you type in the song you have to go through like a whole playlist then you get your song like once I typed in the song and I had to wait like an hour till I could actually get the song that Iwanted,NEGATIVE
"Really tired of the glitches on Spotify over the last few years. Sincerely thinking of switching services. Have to consistently Force Stop and reboot app so that user controls (ability to pause) show back up. Also despise the fact that it boots automatically when linked to my car...annoying if I am not expecting it AND it should be optional, not automatic.",NEGATIVE
Pretty much has turned into the same handful of overplayed songs and ads.,NEGATIVE
THE BEST APP I CAN'T AFFORD PREMIUM BUT STILL ITS THE AMAZINGEST APP HOLE UNIVERSE,POSITIVE
"I love Spotify, but the latest layout change is too much. WHY CHANGE SONETHING THAT WAS PERFECT? AHHHH!!! Don't make me use YouTubeMusic, I might like it more.",NEGATIVE
Its great but not a five star because it will control your volume if you put the volum low it will ture it louder,NEGATIVE
Great music. Easy to use and many artist to listen to as well,POSITIVE
I don't have premium doesn't mean you can add ad's after every 2-3 songs ...it sucks ...please fix it.. Overall app is good but this is the only problem that is irritating.. Edit -- It's getting worse ...seriously ...there so many Ad's ...it shows that get 30 minutes of ad free music but after 10-15 min ...an ad pops up ...and sometimes there are 2-3 ads too...,NEGATIVE
For some reason this app is now trying to open all of my personal audio without my permission and there is no option to stop it. It is not my default audio player and I can not open it any other way. Horrible.,NEGATIVE
App is grt but pls add feature to see wot frens are listening to like pc,NEGATIVE
Spotify the best,POSITIVE
No problem with my music list. Everything plays and no problem with loading the songs,POSITIVE
"The slowest app on my phone, by a large margin. Have tried signing in and out, uninstalling and reinstalling, turning phone on and off, clearing cache and data, everything. This app doesn't run, it saunters with a cane. Also, no way to disable annoying podcasts...NO I WONT LISTEN TO BRO JOGAN",NEGATIVE
The best music app for years,POSITIVE
I love loVE LOVE my Spotify. So many memories from the 90s rock playlists!!! And classic to new Metal ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤˜,POSITIVE
Oh I really liked to can use this app but it doesn't work for me at all..my problem was because of using vpn and I couldn't use it without vpn either! ..idk why it said turn off your vpn..I got a little sad :),NEGATIVE
"Beautiful app,thank you!",POSITIVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE APP BRUH ???? I stopped using for a while and now I just came back and everything is lagging to extreme cases to a blank screen altogether ... Probably will go with YouTube music ... What a disappointment ...,NEGATIVE
Love the discover weekly and how easy it is to share music and playlists with friends.,POSITIVE
Just freeze on the splash screen on my one plus 7t,NEGATIVE
"I honestly don't care what people say about Spotify, I mean a lot of people now hate Spotify and rather listen to songs on YouTube instead. It's most likely because you have to skip songs just to listen to the song that you want, but like if you hate or don't like Spotify than you're just something else (impatient is what you are) any have a good day and don't go on TIKTOK. I'll leave a 5 star review on TIKTOK check bit out.",NEGATIVE
Best music app I have used the best thing is you can down load podcasts to listen offline. I recommend listening to scared to death,NEGATIVE
Can't control the enhanced list. When sharing a session on same network with other users can create IP conflict if the host session finishes,NEGATIVE
It was good for 1 Yr but recently spotify keeps saying no internet is available.. though ny internet connection is good in other apps.. I have reinstalled the app. Connected a different internet.. cleared clache.. but still it says no internet available.. kindly fix this problem,NEGATIVE
"Great app love the podcasts and music selection and suggestions. However, the latest patch I've been getting soft crashes and play bar disappears. Relaunching resolves but it may take more than 1 attempt",NEGATIVE
HORRIBLE I cloud not play one song by its self I tried playing this one single song but it was playlist that had the song in it that I wanted to play so I tired skipping to the part I want but its says I can only do 6 skips which is a dum set up your forced to listen to songs you dont like until u get to the song you want so I tired doing a playlist with only songs I like but then spotify decided that it should add a buch of songs I dont like so then there you are waiting for the song u want.,NEGATIVE
Love â¤ the way the music is selected.,POSITIVE
Worst support... contact support many times all the time they won't solve the issue and tell this is something our customer support can't resolve,NEGATIVE
"For a music lover, like me there is nothing better than this...",NEGATIVE
"Absolutely terrible on mobile. I can never use the mobile version because of how stupidly unbearable it is. How come PC version has unlimited skips AND can play any song in the playlist and mobile can't? And why can't i just make a playlist without other reccommended songs being randomly added and i can't get rid of them? Literally the worst music app, i swear. I can't even play just ONE single song wothout having to play a whole playlist just to get to it. I dont know how people can use this.",NEGATIVE
Bestt app ever... But I would love some changes such as bring the three dot option in search results only so we can add them in queue if we want secondly please add features to make playlist collobrative through app and also to re arrange songs. Overall this is bestt in the music streaming platforms. User since 2011,POSITIVE
Love Spotify! Listen to any music I want anytime!,POSITIVE

"""I love this app! Its great! It makes me listen to my favorite songs and music. Its easy to use, accesible, and reliable"" -what i would say if this app actually works. It doesnt even play the songs that i played. It plays a totally different one. The app is actively FORCING me to buy premium buy how? Not working. Literally impossible to use without premium. This app belongs in the trash along with youtube. They'd make great friends.",POSITIVE
Just the way I want a music app. Switched from YouTube Music.,NEGATIVE
Always good and easy to use,POSITIVE

"It's easy to move around the app (in comparison to Apple music, last time I used it). Also finding what you are looking for is simple.",POSITIVE
"every app ask for 5 star , but this app clearly deserve that",POSITIVE
"In my opinion Spotify is a great app/software for music but the thing is that I have premiun and there isn't that much you can do in premiun except downloading and no adds and that's kinda all, they should add more things to premiun",NEGATIVE
Too much of ads,NEGATIVE
Get the music of your mood.. Anytime.. Anywhere!!!,POSITIVE
Thank you for bringing back the ability to preview songs before adding to playlist!!!,POSITIVE
They give the perfect lyrics and I enjoy clear music,POSITIVE

Awesome. This is best music app by far,POSITIVE
Love love LOVE the Spanish ads!! Always wanted to fine tune my multilingual skills while cutting grass! Please play more of those. I don't know what they said but I want to order 10 of those right now!,POSITIVE
50% of the time the app crashes when you start a podcast. Genuinely one of the worst apps I've ever used. It just crashes all the time,NEGATIVE
Keeps kicking it self out. So annoying. I have that it plays 3 songs and it cuts out. Need to fix,NEGATIVE
"Have to get premium, or the ads drive you unhappy.",NEGATIVE
Good song quality and less ads... Highly recommend,POSITIVE
Has been crashing lately when trying to play music or podcasts,NEGATIVE
"I have no idea if something's wrong with my Phone, but the new GUI is so confusing now, I can't choose specific songs on my playlist and it forces me to listen to suggestions, this is not improving the app in any way, shape, or form, please revert this back to the old GUI.",NEGATIVE
It's very useful and helpful,POSITIVE
I love Spotify.,POSITIVE
Just Great music love it .,POSITIVE

After latest update app crashes every time it's opened,NEGATIVE
This app is amazing and it's sound quality just wow,POSITIVE
The app is great loads of music and affordable the app does have a tendency to act up where the pp won't display what your playing so you have to force close the the app to pause or stop audio playback.,NEGATIVE
Great app love the music have the best,POSITIVE
It was gd. Bt some songs are not fully available and Some songs lyrics r not available.. So I'm posting 3 â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸rs... ðŸ™‚,NEGATIVE

This app is very good for music lovers!This is very good recommendation!,POSITIVE
"It has no drawbacks or anythingas such. But just way to many advertisements, all about Spotify. Only that has to decrease a bit",NEGATIVE
I can listen to any songs and that's what I like about it,POSITIVE
Great!!! Easy to use.,POSITIVE
Can't rewind can't play the specific song I want why is it always the shuffle button can't I play the songs that I actually want?,NEGATIVE
"The update is honestly WAAY too restricting.The forced shuffle feature on every user that isnt on premium is just...so unappreciatedable to the point where its clear that,the only target is money. But if you just wanna listen to music this app would be alright, The quality of the songs that are played are great besides the whole forced shuffle thing",POSITIVE
Now playing controls disappear on a Samsung S22 Ultra. Only remedy appears to be to restart phone.,NEGATIVE
Always begins with shuffle and shuffle can't be stopped. It does play music so two stars. It's not usable in my car.,NEGATIVE
"After 1 hours(Non stop) used this app and I think after 10 time advertisement I received that, Why should I get a premium a/c?. And I realised this app creator does not care about if I'm listen music through their app(when I used in free), I cannot get into a mood of my favourite song list (like songs) cuz advertisement always interrupted me. When 2nd or 3rd time I received advertisement I think I must get premium. But after 10 times, I'll never waste money on this app, I'll uninstall this app.",NEGATIVE
"Absolutely Terrible. I used to like this app but after it's update I despise it, it updated the ""music in background"" so you can't play it in the background or when you turn off your phone anymore. Giving this a one star, hate it and never using it again.",NEGATIVE
My Spotify app has stopped working completely. Can't play a song. Every playlist is shown as blank screen. Please solve it. I need Spotify.,NEGATIVE
best music experience and no Spotify without harry styles,POSITIVE
"Through android auto, Spotify is loud for the first couple of seconds. Then the volume dips, and the music is only as loud as you speak, despite being cracked to the max. All other apps through AA or the radio/Sirius in the car don't do this. Why does Spotify keep shting the bed? Problem solved: bought a tesla with built in Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Bc of the advertisement all ways ruing my mood,NEGATIVE
"I would give spotify a 5 star rating, but out of the blue it started cutting in and out inside my house and out in the yard. Spotify works great in my vehicles, I don't get it, it makes crushing beers outside less enjoyable when you have spoty music.",POSITIVE
"Stop running gay pride ads in my Christian conservative podcasts. It's blatantly an obvious attempt to push the alternative opinion in it, and it's going to make me cancel spotify for taking an immoral abhorrent stance. You are a content provider, do just that, stop picking sides.",NEGATIVE
The volume difference between music and ads is atrocious.,NEGATIVE
"The playing now bar has disappeared again, and it keeps happening. There's no way yo pause, stop, or skip music without it. This has been an issue for over two months. Fix it spotify.",NEGATIVE
Good Playlist and providing opportunities to upcoming music talent also.,POSITIVE
Too much ads.,NEGATIVE
Botched everything up recently. Please make it better or back to how it was.,NEGATIVE
It great but I just don't know how to play music from the new update because if I press the song I wanna play it just plays a part of it if someone could tell me how to play a song I'd be glad,NEGATIVE
I'm giving one star â­ because the application giving advertising even one song. Before some time the application not give advertising even one song so please fix This ads.,NEGATIVE
...Spotify is my favorite Music App!!...love making my own playlists!!...,POSITIVE
Great app for streaming music,POSITIVE
It makes no sense that you can connect to Bluetooth headphones to listen but not too your smart watch to listen without a premium subscription,NEGATIVE
You broke it. This last update causes the app to crash constantly. Unusable.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a great app, however it has a few hiccups. 1, it's ads for the free version. The ads are a nightmare, instead of 1 or 2 every 30 minutes. It's 3 or 4 every 15 minutes. 2, downloaded songs have a little downloaded emblem in the playlist. It disappears sometimes and having a 100+ song playlist is a lot of storage space. With all of that, Spotify is a good app. Premium is almost required but it's only 9.99 a month. I love the podcast selection they have too. There's something for anyone!",NEGATIVE
"Why is it when I search for a song, and find it, I can't just play it. Instead I have to shuffle and play a playlist that it's in - get a grip Spotify, I won't renew my premium until this issue is resolved",NEGATIVE
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.,NEGATIVE
Nice app.but when I try to play a song that's In a Playlist all the songs come up and I can't hear the song that I chose.i will rate this a 4.5 out if 5.,NEGATIVE
Always recommended but you always need a strong internet to play songs .,POSITIVE
Full of adds,POSITIVE
This app is amazing. We can hear any type of songs we want. And the best thing I like that there are lyrics also available. Just love this app ðŸ˜ â¤ï¸ ðŸ’–ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
"Awesome! Thank you so much for such a wonderful app, i can listen any music and podcast i want. Thank you developer for free, you have a big heart.",POSITIVE
Great for finding music I missed or had forgotten,POSITIVE
The only thing that keeps this app going is the fact that it uses less battery than YouTube and Apple music isn't available to Android users. You can't even rewind a song without hearing 3 ads. Then they tell you that you have 30 minutes of ad free music. That lasts until you click a song. Or for about 10 minutes. What the hell happened to this app??,NEGATIVE
"It doesnt let me play the song i want , it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this.",NEGATIVE
Best audio quality The music app ever I seen,POSITIVE
"I like the app, but I don't like that it is always stuck downloading songs in the background and gets stuck until I open Spotify. Idk if it's clever marketing to get the user to open the app, or if it's a bug...either way it is very annoying and has forced me to consider canceling my premium after years of being a subscriber to Hulu/Spotify. I'm sure no one reads these reviews after reading a few of the others. Shame on you spotify",NEGATIVE
Stop adding music we didn't even add,NEGATIVE
Good flow of enriching songs,POSITIVE
Very neat. Really good UI and very enjoyable,POSITIVE
"What the fk is happening? Occasionally pauses, sometimes turn the volume up without any contact with my phone, that lies comfortably in my pocket! Why????? This is getting too anoying! update 17 06 22: it wasn't the app, but 3,5mm connector in my phone all great now",NEGATIVE
"I used to love using this app, but now you have to pay inorder to listen to your own music. The mechanic is overall really stupid and annoying",NEGATIVE
Wish it wasn't pay to listen offline sadface great app still,NEGATIVE
"Been using this app for years even use it while playing my PS4, but lately this app hasn't been working like it used to. Automatically skips to the next track without even asking/hitting next track, on it's OWN. And then a lot of music I had saved on my playlist starts to disappear without me editing the playlist, there one day gone the next. It's really weird that this app does that A LOT. Used to rate this 5* their lucky I'm rating this 3*.",NEGATIVE
All of a sudden app doesn't want to work. I can't play anything nor does it show my Playlists. I've had to use the browser in order to listen to music which doesn't make easier when driving.,NEGATIVE
I really love this app but it has 1 problem. Some of the album covers on Spotify have inappropriate cover and appear as an NSFW. I feel like this should be removed as there are kids on the application as well.,NEGATIVE
Very easy to use,POSITIVE
After years of listening to other apps Spotify has won me over.,POSITIVE
"logs out off your account for no reason sometimes, lost my account once. ad plays after every song and not thirty minutes unless you have premium. but a great music listening app regardless.",POSITIVE
Love this app! I am always able to find music thst I loved growing up and that I love now to add to my Playlists!!,POSITIVE
Keeps updating now you can't even click on a specific song from a. Artist gotta play threw shuffle for 4 hrs to get the 9ne song you want to listen to,NEGATIVE
"The bloody autoplay feature just won't stop! It keeps playing random songs I don't like and didn't even added to the Playlist despite disabling it in the settings. After playing those annoying songs, ads roll in that lasts for like a minute or so. Instead of putting me in a good mood, it did the exact opposite. Don't use this app unless you have the budget for premium subscription. LISTENING MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IS WAY BETTER THAN AN APP LITERALLY CREATED FOR LISTENING MUSIC.",NEGATIVE
Wonderful! Awesome! Spectacular!,POSITIVE
"I used to love this app but these ads have gotten out of hand. If I have to listen to this many ads, I'll just close it and go to pandora...",NEGATIVE
I'm using Spotify almost 2 / 3 years ... Nowadays you are putting so many ads it's irritating i 2 ads to listen one tamil songs stupid ... I'm going to un install worst experience ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
App keeps crashing everytime I open it and as a paying customer that is unacceptable. Please fix.,NEGATIVE
Love how you can build your own play list and play off line wouldn't be without it now,POSITIVE
"So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly in airplane mode, when you should still be able to listen to downloaded episodes. Also crashes occasionally.",NEGATIVE

I love the lack of commercials and the fact that I an play things up to 3.5x speed.,NEGATIVE
"I enjoyed listening to my music new and old, especially when I'm on my runs,bike riding.music free your soul and spirit.",POSITIVE
The best music app out there.,POSITIVE
Even tho I payed for a premium plan i dont have podcasts available,NEGATIVE
Bug reporting: Cannot share a remote session with someone. When they open the link it just brings them to the Spotify homepage. The year of our lord Jesus Christ is 2022 and for some god foresaken reason I am sat on a bus and unable to listen to music with my girlfriend.. Why Why Why,NEGATIVE
Very very good music from Spotify,POSITIVE

The song quality is very good,POSITIVE
THIS APP SUCKS NOW THE NEW UPDATE LIKE I CANT DIRECTLY PLAY THE SONG I WANT I HATE THIS APP NOW TF!!!,NEGATIVE
"I made a playlist specifically dedicated to a game, but theres also songs that spotify automatically adds and theres absolutely no way to disable them, so therefore this absolutely ruins my experience in every single way, shape or form",NEGATIVE
"It would be great if there was a ""listen later"" feature that you could add artists your friends recommend to you in the moment.",POSITIVE
We want a stunning looking widget for Android 12,POSITIVE
Lots of music wich I love but spotify needs to pay their music artists more money.,NEGATIVE
way better than pandora. Whatever algorithm it has it knows what I want to hear. it doesn't just randomly put a song I hate or the same song on there. And not everything's mainstream and the podcast are the truth.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the only music platform that's goes the extra mile for both artist and listener,NEGATIVE
"Now look, Im not sure if this is a problem for everyone but it is for sure a problem with me. Not sure if it is a new update, but whenever I try to listen to one of my liked songs, It only plays a small part of the song. And whenever I search up the song. I have to shuffle it with ""recommended songs"" that I wont even like. Not only that, but when I shuffled my liked songs, it doesnt allow me to go back to a previous song. Please change this, I at least want to enjoy music in a freedom-ful way",POSITIVE
The most non user friendly streaming service I have tried. I would give it zero stars if I could.,NEGATIVE
tbh Spotify is great just i wish they had slowed versions of songs like YouTube does,POSITIVE
"Recently it's become just awful. Too glitchy, sends me podcast recommendations that I don't even watch, the volume becomes high then low then high again randomly without me doing anything, it's just an overall horrible experience",NEGATIVE
"I've been using Spotify for a while now, and a premium subscriber so no ads. It's a pretty decent app. The problem I have with it is the random genre of music that is thrown into your daily mixes; with no option on the app to delete or change your preferences. They'll say keep listening to your favourite music and it'll change over time, but it doesn't. It gets pretty annoying real fast when you're seeing recommendations constantly from genres you've never listened to. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
"Great application but I'm kinda disappointed that i can't download the songs anymore even though i pay the spotify premium mini and pop up texts that said ""device limit reached"" even though i only downloaded 20 songs (max 30) and only use one device",NEGATIVE
Love it. I can have my music any where. 1 downside if my son and I use our account at the same time. one of us will have to use our downloaded music.,POSITIVE
Good app but the audio needs to be authorised,NEGATIVE
Absolutely useless allways off-line why?????????,NEGATIVE
Please make sure that the panels don't lag on low internet connection. Why would I have to wait so much time just to add a song I have downloaded to my queue,NEGATIVE
"This app has become a problem, why do you always have to download all the songs over and over again after you did it for the first time. Buffers all the time, will crush out of nowhere. And all that on premium. We don't get what we pay for.",NEGATIVE
"The app is good, but the lyric won't show for nun of the songs",POSITIVE
Good App..Doesn't have ads between songs and has a wide variety..Let's you explore new genres....,POSITIVE
Impossible to use on lock screen anymore. Tried everything I could find Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Android 12,NEGATIVE
It's a pretty good app I just wish that I didn't have to pay after my free month,POSITIVE
Can please make your advertising so good because no one wants to just spent premium for it like i just want to listen songs freely but now i cant now I cant play any song what i want I cant timestamp I need to shuffle play even though its bad I wish you can just do this pls cuz we dont want to spend premium to have these features,NEGATIVE
"Not badðŸ™‚ and getting it""free""...one can live with intermittent interruptions. subtle way to persuade one to upgrade to premium. but, hey, as you americans often say, "" there ain't no free lunches..."" so one enjoys what one can get ""free""ðŸ¤— right?",POSITIVE
Often crashes when trying to start playing a file.,NEGATIVE
Very good app to hear music,POSITIVE
This app is getting worse and worse..basic functionality randomly doesn't work. What is going on at Spotify? Are you having interns working on the productive release without quality assurance or supervision? Seems like the age of subscription based models are over.,NEGATIVE
Sound quality is really nice i loved it,POSITIVE
Why is the download getting stuck every single day at 99% ... drives me nuts,NEGATIVE
"app keeps pausing music, very annoying",NEGATIVE
Very good advertisement. songs always disturbe the advertisement. ðŸ˜Œ,NEGATIVE
Great music and songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
"Logged into my account, but couldn't listen to music nor see my playlist of the songs I liked and downloaded and I'm mad because I had 57 days left for my premium. This needs to be fixed immediately!!",NEGATIVE
good songs that they add it is for free and I love it,POSITIVE
Very bed exercise.no any song play without add useless app,NEGATIVE
"Need help.. I redid my account after nearly 10ish years. It says I have no internet access, but I know I do. I've looked at all the settings in the app, I just can't figure it out.",NEGATIVE
Awesome.good experience.only one problem that for some songs lyrics are not available.,NEGATIVE
"I've been using it for years and the only problem I've ever encountered is that it crashes way too often, especially when I'm trying to click on a podcast episode.",NEGATIVE
giving 2 much ads,NEGATIVE
"Unless you pay for it, it's trash. But once you pay it's less trash, still trash but less than before. You're better off buying the CDs or even downloading the songs from the bands official website.",NEGATIVE
"I like Spotify, but why does the free plan force you to play music on shuffle? That's dumb. Why should I have to listen to a bunch of other songs before I get to listen to the one I wanted? You do realise how dumb that sounds, right?",NEGATIVE
Very Very nice music very very nice ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜€,POSITIVE
So bad... when I want to listen to a song it will bring other songs. I hate this ðŸ˜’,NEGATIVE
IT is a great great great experience with Spotify and it can tell us story . I am impressed with spotify ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify! Premium is the only way to go, however. Have many playlists. Awesome.",POSITIVE
This is a nice app but the problem is that it shows you are offline even though you are online it is annoying.,NEGATIVE
"It's a music app that does its job, playing music",POSITIVE
Sometimes it just stops working â˜¹,NEGATIVE
It was terrible i can't even play the song i want it keeps taking me to a other one like stop choosing my music i know what i wanna listen to,NEGATIVE
Good app except the share streaming link doesn't even work on a consistent enough basis. Very frustrating.,NEGATIVE
Really good and easy to use! I like this app and I hope others install it to listen to their favorite music! And plus I like the fact that it also has lyrics to it too.,POSITIVE
All type excellent song,POSITIVE
"Great alot of the time, really sucks some of the time",POSITIVE
"I have been using Spotify premium for 1 year and it has become an application that I really cannot give up. The only problem is that some songs do not open when offline mode is turned on for too long, even though they are downloaded. I think this problem needs to be corrected",NEGATIVE
Keeps crashing piece of sh,POSITIVE
They have all the songs I like! I 100% recommend installing this app,POSITIVE
"The android version of this app is a nightmare. It doesn't let me listen to the song I want, instead shuffling no matter what I do. The iOS and Windows versions of the app never gave my any trouble.",NEGATIVE
It's as good as the desktop app bar a few missing features. None of which spring to mind ATM...,POSITIVE
"Uninstalled. Why? Because automatically plays after I've paused it, closed it and ended the program from running in the background. It starts playing after my phone connects to my Bluetooth. Infuriating.",NEGATIVE
It really just has every song you want ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
I've enjoyed using Spotify!,POSITIVE
Its a really good app except the inability for users to download songs for offline use...... Really sad,POSITIVE
Ugh...i don't like the new updateðŸ˜’now..i can't hear my fav song when i am play game ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
"Too many pop ups, adverts ever 3 songs for the free version and they're the same adverts. YouTube isn't this bad!",NEGATIVE

"I cannot see what I am playing at the moment, as soon as I hit play the playing controls does not appear. Once I restart the phone is back to normal but after I stop listening for a while the problem is back again.",NEGATIVE
Please add option of setting wapaper of artist on phone like groove music in windows,NEGATIVE
"Everything is OK but it will be better if you don't give so many ads, and one more thing there are not many songs like jin's super tuna and more",NEGATIVE
"So disappointed in this app. I installed it to listen to some podcasts that are only available on Spotify. I thought since I had it I try listening to music on it. Boy was that a mistake! It will only Shuffle the playlist, it adds ""recommended"" songs in the middle of a song that's already playing & now I can only play music that I have on my phone in Spotify - the other app I was using no longer works. It will only play some of the files and not all of the files that used to play. Uninstalling.",NEGATIVE
Amazing app for Music,POSITIVE
Excellent app. Live Spotify!!,POSITIVE
Extremely amazing and really helps when I need a release from stress because I can just listen to my music and it doesn't have ads about itself pop up every 2 seconds,POSITIVE
I fell for fake news for hating spotify . I was wrong and i love joe rogan podcast . Thx fake news to introduce me to his podcast. The most reasonable autentic podcast . I wish we had a french canadian version of the joe rogan podcast. Someone step up plz.,NEGATIVE
"All honesty it's ok but it's really frustrating when it plays a song that I never up into my Playlist no matter how many I put in it. Please fix this I want to listen to my music not the music that you play for me, thanks. Also for some reason it doesn't di that on my computer",NEGATIVE
All the favourites are on here. Its amazing,POSITIVE
I love music so Spotify,POSITIVE
Always stop functioning in back ground,NEGATIVE
Too many adds. Constant issues with skipping to next song. Practically useless.,NEGATIVE
A good song with clear sound And the best experience I had ever done,POSITIVE
I've had the app for a few months with premium. It was great until I went offline for a while and when I went back online none of my Playlists were showing up. I tried logging on to my account from a different device and it showed all my Playlist.,NEGATIVE
Too many ad's,NEGATIVE
"Impressive, premium gives best experience",POSITIVE
"I own $10,000.00 worth of I tunes. For life. But Spotify is much better to use. There have been several times I have requested a more extensive coverage and complete Diskorgraphy of some well known Artist and groups and Spotify has expanded these. There is now easier to use choices of how to create playlists and for many songs real time lyrics makes it easier to understand the words and make your favorite songs much more singable. You'll like Spotify...",POSITIVE
"Non-stop exuberance, only next to God's Presence. Great worship!!",POSITIVE
"Kind of weird how your app seems to crash every time I select a podcast that has a covid-19 banner, even one I've already previously started listening to",NEGATIVE
Ok guys I don't listen to Manowar anymore but Spotify still sucks,NEGATIVE
The best app for music,POSITIVE
keeps adding songs I never added. devs are retarded.,NEGATIVE
To much advertising and most of the music it play ain't even on my list it's just a headache when i want to hear my music.,NEGATIVE
"A few adds but it's really nice! You can listen to any song. I can play songs even when the network is very slow, although it takes some time to load but then it works just smooth!",POSITIVE
"It's a good app, I'm fine with the adds after a few songs here and there! But i don't know if anyone else is having this problem, wafter a few hours (depends on the headphones) my music starts to glitch a lot while I'm sleeping or drawing/ doing anything else I require music it always does. Also I'm needing to unpause it everytime it hits an add mostly in the morning when I try to sleep in. Try your best to fix this please!",NEGATIVE
Your app sucks! Songs wiill stop playing and very glitchy. Might cancel my subscription if this issue is not resolved soon.,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming in app.,POSITIVE
Makes life easy. And I've discovered a lot of killer tunes that I wouldn't know if I continued with the radio ðŸ¥º,POSITIVE
"Lacks content horrible service, bit odd",NEGATIVE
Its good but you can't have more than one person on the acc at a time,POSITIVE
Love it. Use lyrics and they find the song for you.,POSITIVE
"Lots of good content. The software is garbage. It freezes every time I use it; it never connects to the internet without my help; does not sync with Android Auto. Glitches galore, and it pisses me off every time I use the stupid app.",NEGATIVE
Best variety of good musicians... I'm overwhelmed with this experience that I choose to rate at 5 stars... Very Satisfied...,POSITIVE
I like this app even though the ads is a lot which is a bit disturbing when I listen to music,POSITIVE
"I love it. I like that I'm able to pause, rewind and fast-forward my favorite podcasts",POSITIVE
You cant preview songs anymore before adding them to playlists this is super annoying especially when you find out you added the wrong song,NEGATIVE
"I like Spotify, but ever since I've downloaded it it hasn't been working well. It will not let me listen to ANY music, when I try to make a playlist it logs me off. And I would really appreciate it if you fixed this, I would love to listen to my music. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
The premium version (the ad-free one) is good.,POSITIVE
"It could be better, it could be worse. I haven't used premium service; 1. Because I don't want to pay for something I downloaded for free only to use my Bose speaker. 2. I haven't been able to get just what I look for and what i do find has a bunch of other stuff with it that is REALLY random. Maybe I am just too use to YouTube and how it is designed. I hope with updates my mind will change.",NEGATIVE
Very easy to use with an enormous range of music.,POSITIVE
Pretty bad almost unusable... Podcasts cant play.,NEGATIVE
I love how it let's you play music with your phone off without premium,POSITIVE
The app simply doesn't work. It keeps closing for no reason. Reinstalled again and again. Worst music app.,NEGATIVE
Too much of advertisement it's irritating,NEGATIVE
"I understand yall need to make money, but 5 Ads in a row is Ridiculous!! (YES I counted and am not trying to trash talk, because besides this it is a great platform.)",POSITIVE
"Perpetually crashes, really annoying, terrible app",NEGATIVE
"Layout keeps getting worse, adding podcasts is cool but shifting between episodes depending on ads and losing progress continuously, is no way to run anything. 06/16- I have it set to download to my microSD and it'll work fine for a while till either an update or something changes then it will start using my phone again, I'll have to delete some podcast to transition some over to card and then the app will lock up so I have to reinstall it again. ðŸ™„",NEGATIVE
"Everything in the app is good. But I have a suggestion that if you could add captions to all the audio podcasts as well than it would be nice, as it will help in improving our English I hope you take a look at this suggestion.",POSITIVE
Bruh After this update i cant even play the songs that i want it just shuffles it and u cant even disable the shuffle because it does not exist anymore like what kind of music app doesn't have a shuffle disable and it just pick a random music sometimes and not on your liked songs and the worst part is you can only skip 6 times in 6 hours like bruh i used to love this app but after the update its dead for me i regret updating the app i should have not updated it when its not even forcing me pfttt,NEGATIVE
"For some reason it stops playing my music out of nowhere, or it will stop playing for a couple seconds and starts playing again, it happens often to a Point where it's really annoying!! I thought it was my phone but I recently got a new one and it still happens",NEGATIVE
This Spotify is my stress buster but more advertisement are coming I'm not like thatðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
CALM THE ADS. I WANT MUSIC NOT ADS. FOR EVERY SONG I GET 3 ADS. RIDICULOUS. And why the hell would you get rid of the preview. I'm done with Spotify. When I initially wrote the review I was mad about ADS but no now they are WORSE. 1 ad for every song. And I'm not paying 120 a year to not listen to ADS. Now crashes every time I exit the app and go back in witch I do very often to skip the ads. This app is absolutely bs. Do not get it.,NEGATIVE
Web version way better so much things that you have to pay for even simple basic thing,POSITIVE
As long as you have Spotify premium this is the best app in the world!,POSITIVE
Thanks for the 15 minutes of ad free music,POSITIVE
Great but wish they would mix it up more.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify's choice in recommendations . Also the variety in their generated music playlist.,POSITIVE
"it's an amazing app, get all the music you want ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
"You get 1 star so I can tell people if your not paying for premium they forcefully make you watch ads after every single song picked , this app is a waste of time, since they've changed it!",NEGATIVE
Literally my most used app. It's incredibly good for music lovers and playlist enthusiasts! Playlist creation is incredibly easy and intuitive. Sharing music is easy and the library of music is nearly endless. 11/10.,POSITIVE
"I originally liked the business model. I'd rather pay for a better service and now I do. So I uninstalled Spotify for the final time. I'll enjoy my high quality lossless music elsewhere. I maintain a library of lossless music and expect the same from my apps. Amazon and apple deliver. So goodbye forever Spotify, you can suck it.",NEGATIVE
"Love the app, it's great because it has pretty much everything I've looked for except a few eclectic punk bands.",POSITIVE
This is the best music app ever,POSITIVE
The app used to be perfect but for the past months the queue feature has been completely messed up. It keeps deleting what I add to the queue. With every update I hope this will get solved but it doesn't.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is a good online music playing app.,POSITIVE
its ad free app so fully enjoyed without any disturbance... please please go and download,POSITIVE
Its easy to use this app..i m happy with itðŸŒ,POSITIVE
Music familiar ðŸŽ¶ and I like it,POSITIVE
Spotify uses a lot of data ...way to much!!,NEGATIVE
Pay spotify yeah you're pretty good but I know but I don't listen to much that because the email email the email that email the email was the hardest thing to make How do you Do this you're so amazingly good it makes I can't I just can't I don't know what to say you're so gorgeous You're waiting for this this is the last thing I said I love you spotify,NEGATIVE
"Love it! Love it! Love it! i love Spotify! I can listen to it and turn the screen off, play a game or do something online and it continues to play without stopping, pausing or shutting off. I love it! it is definitely a must have music app! Thumbs up! :-)",POSITIVE
Has an excellent selection of music and reminds me of some I'd somehow forgotten!,POSITIVE
I love Spotify it's the on music app I have but the bad part is it don't work when you have no internet but other than that I have no other problems Spotify is amazing â˜ºï¸ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜!!!!,POSITIVE
It's so annoying I wanna play my playlist in order not shuffle I also made a playlists with only two songs and I clicked the play button and played a song that's not even in the playlist and it's so frustrating,NEGATIVE
Spotify music app is a very good app enjoyable and relaxing,POSITIVE
"This is a well done app, it has background play even when you're phone is off. But the best part is the music diversity and it will recommend music to you no matter what genera!",POSITIVE
"The app is good and all,altho i dont have premium due to finance issues, the adds seem to be getting excessive like 2-3 30 second adds after just 2-3 songs and i used to be every 30 minutes which was acceptable...My other problem is when you play a playlist, altho considerate i wish i could turn off the ""feature"" where itll add songs that i may like because i want to listen to the songs i already have in the list and not have to waste the,considerate, 6 skips you allow nonpremium users. The end.",NEGATIVE
"Ok so u used this app to listen to all my favorite songs for years, But got it on a phone and it was different. Idk if it's the divice type but this made me stop using the app, so first, when I go to find a song and click on it, I canot loop it. Secondly, when I save songs to my playlist I cant listen to the ones i want to, it just makes me listen to all of my songs when I dont want to, Thirdly, when I search up a song it doesn't let me play it, instead it plays other songs from the creator.",NEGATIVE
This is an amazing app .I love it .it have all of ur favorite songs ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
"Love this app! Plays in the background easily, but alot of ads... Get one every two songs! And I have a lot of songs in my Playlist. So if you guys can put less ads would be really good!",NEGATIVE
Convenience. Can listen to all genres of songs. A comprehensive list of artist and singers both old and young.,POSITIVE
I used to love this app it was the best free or you could do the premium at a good price BUT my wife has made several playlists and they no longer just play just the songs on the playlist they.also play the recommended or added songs and she does not like that so why has it changed so much? We were going to do some songs for a picnic we were having it was playing songs we did not want,NEGATIVE
"Its saying i have no connection when im on wifi, then it wont load my playlist i have just updated the app and the issue still remains",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify! Definitely my favorite! Especially premium. So awesome. Thank you guys for doing such a great job!!!,POSITIVE
Best music player in android,POSITIVE
Wonderful! I've been with Spotify since you had to be invited to join.,POSITIVE
"I love spotify so much but I have 1 issue, when I'm playing songs on my Playlist it will sometimes play 3 songs and then skip to some old country music that I never added to my Playlist, other than that 5 stars!",NEGATIVE
i really like the app jus wish they added a higher volume,NEGATIVE
Mean love it all the way hard,POSITIVE
"It's very nice with the music but with the ""we added"" in your Playlist it gets very annoying",NEGATIVE
"If your having issues, try logging out and back in again. Might help, clearing the catch and data if need be.",NEGATIVE
"Bloated, unorganized, and a data-hog. Features like playlists and favorite artists are cumbersome to navigate and inconsistent.",NEGATIVE
"Broken app. The past few months has seen issue after issue, many of the problems experienced during cross play. The phone app freezes after trying to skip a few songs while playing on another device, 75% of the time. Still a paying customer as the service overall is pretty awesome, just small annoying things every now and then.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a really good app that you can listen to without problems, u can listen to ur favorite musics and broadcast. BUT there's always a but, the only think disturbing is that we should hsve a premium account to access good stuff. Appart of it, Spotify is a really good app love it .",POSITIVE
I loved it until the recent update. Why did you take off the snippet.,POSITIVE
"good app for music , recommend",POSITIVE
The only place i listen to music phenominal app,NEGATIVE

Simple and satisfying,POSITIVE
Great service ðŸ‘ Customer support is always fair and helpful.,POSITIVE
"Absloute PERFECTION, Beyond you wildest dreams, wrapped with opportunity and professionalism.",POSITIVE
this is the best music app ever. The ads only show up every now and and when they do it's only two or three ads.,POSITIVE
"China style censorship, need more free speech platforms like Rumble. Alex Jones was correct so you banned him and others. Banned.video for real information. Stand with freedom or lose.",NEGATIVE
I love to use spotify,POSITIVE
Best app for the music anyone's looking for â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸,POSITIVE
I would give 0 if I could. I got this app and it worked great at first. For almost a month now I have been unable to play anything. I can get in just fine and even search things to listen to but as soon as I try to play something it tells me to check my internet connection. My phone has service and even connecting to my wifi network it still doesn't help. I was even planning on getting primeum next month but now I don't think there is a point.,NEGATIVE
"Guess I got 1st 2wks no ads. Very few ads. Came here from Pandora and I don't miss it. Wish the rotation and shuffle were better but they have a lot of personalized mixes. Love that there's podcasts, a variety of music, and comedy too.",POSITIVE
It's was good to listen music...and adds coming on every 30 minutes..now a days I got an update on last month and it's too forcing to buy premium every 2 songs minimum 3 adds coming.. it's not far..... it's too irritating....,NEGATIVE
I recommend using this app I thought they charge but surprisingly they don't but the only thing I don't like is they I get to many emails but I still like this app to listen to musicâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Really good for music options ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
"During the birthing throes of the interweb, their was a music algorithym that would tantalize the soul with sounds close to your liking based on the least prompting frim the user. Alas, as moon landing equipment has also become too complex for this now, 126 years later, an arcane and worfully incompetent modern technology couldnt dare venture a decent musical guess. At $13.99. A month. Jesus its trash.",NEGATIVE
It is super irritating that you can only skip 6 songs per hour. I'm thinking I'll switch back to my other steaming app.,NEGATIVE
amazing app for all music,POSITIVE
"Wonderful! I would love a bit more intuition for the Android app like the Apple version is, but it does the job. Most of my songs recommended aren't similar to what I listen to, but you'll find a nugget or two. Neat stuff",POSITIVE
Like how it will put music together for you based on what you have listened to,POSITIVE
Has most... but not all... the songs I know. No David Caradine....,NEGATIVE
Sadly I'm not able to stream anything or log out without my app saying no wifi connection or my wifi doesn't work. My wifi works fine! Please fix this,NEGATIVE
I love the music I pick from your app!!!!!,POSITIVE
PREMIUM USER: Please if I purchase a premium plan don't show more ads!!,NEGATIVE
"It seems Spotify is Abit clickish, but free is greatness.",POSITIVE
"The app is awful. Volume controls are terrible, shuffle always turns itself on, grrr it, Spotify itself is great",NEGATIVE
other competitors? never heard of em only know Spotify,NEGATIVE
I so love the fact that I can play at the background,POSITIVE
Spotify should be able to download on Mac but its not,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and great variety,POSITIVE
All I gotta say is Spotify is frustrating asf to use.,NEGATIVE
Grate other than the adds but I understand that the ads pay for the app to even exist cuz this world sucks and nobody pays nobody nothing for anything and everybody struggles so hey man I'll deal with the ads you guys the app is great bye,NEGATIVE
So far good just need to load more groups,POSITIVE
Overall good experience nice interface I am totally satisfy with spotify every experience but if you reduce 1 month charges 89 rupees genuinely i am glad and It's become a more good option for music lover and I will recommend,POSITIVE
"Excellent app.. Nice playlists, easy interface.. 5 stars",POSITIVE
I don't know why they changed the option to heart a song on the locked screen. It was really helpful,POSITIVE
Problems connecting to music playlist from Android phone. Not sure where the problem is. Already have established music playlist which is favorable. Any suggestions?,NEGATIVE
I love how it plays in the background and you don't have to pay for that.,POSITIVE
"They removed one of the features that I used the most and I hate it. The preview the song before adding it to the playlist was what I used to add new music that was recommended to me by spotify, now I see that it's like ""hey you may like this song"" but now I have to add the song to my playlist, listen to it and then delete it if I dont like it, when before I could listen to like 3 seconds to know if it's my kind of song . Bring that features back!",NEGATIVE
Great for making playlists and listening to a wide variety of music.,POSITIVE
Improving all the time. I love the lyrics now provided for most songs and also how it picks up all types of smart/connected speakers.,POSITIVE
Great app i just cant listen to some songs. They say they arent available on my device.,POSITIVE
My favorite feature is recommendations. I have discovered good music because of it,POSITIVE
Has started randomly skipping a TON during playback in this latest version. It runs so poorly now. Huge waits to get through the interface and weird inscrutable bugs. I wonder if they test their software or if they just spit out changes whenever they feel like it. (Even their update notes are a snub to the user.),NEGATIVE
Great music selection love it,POSITIVE
It crashes everyday i use spotify alot and it keeps crashing,NEGATIVE
ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜¡ worst ...continuous ads.! Irritating,NEGATIVE
mediocre sounds quality,NEGATIVE
Love the app been using it for years now but just recently I've noticed that some songs that are saved im my playlist can't be played at all they're still in my playlist but its been grayed out and skips it completely. Examples the album Dr.Dre and doggystyle from snoop dog some of the songs are grayed out. Plus I've been able to play them b4 now i cant anymore. If someone can explain why that would be very helpful.,NEGATIVE
I was using Spotify mainly for listening to podcasts but lately it has become unusable. It quits randomly or appears to not play anything when playing. It needs fixing.,NEGATIVE
The app will stop play when the screen timeout and I'll have to log out and back in. Also the audio will stop and the player will disappear so I can't pause or skip. Closing the app does not fix it. It is happening more often which is very frustrating since I pay for a subscription.,NEGATIVE
"great experience, been using it for years!!",POSITIVE
great playlists. I love the concert notifications based on my listening.,POSITIVE
Been using for years to build my music collection,POSITIVE
"I love Spotify it is really good to use. Although the shuffle button has been driving me crazy. Every time I go on a Playlist the shuffle button is always there, and I hate the shuffle button because I put my favorite songs in a certain order, and when I shuffle my music it goes out of order and then it plays only five songs and then goes on autoplay when I know I have more than five songs on every Playlist. I want the version where we just had the play button. Not just the shuffle button.",NEGATIVE
Even after the new update it keeps rejecting my card for Spotify premium,NEGATIVE
Very good but due to less features for free plan users 4 stars rest is very good,POSITIVE
its assssss i kant even go bak on the song i wanna listen to nd if i prush a song on there its just goin tell me sum bs,NEGATIVE
"Bruh this is so annoying, it's a good app but there's just really stupid features like when I'm playing my playlist and it plays random songs that I never even added and I cant even remove it, it adds random songs I don't want on my playlist.its gotten to the point where IL search up a song and when I click play it plays a random whole different song, this app sucks now. PLEASE FIX THIS",NEGATIVE
"After the most recent update, songs pause randomly on different Samsung phones, even after troubleshooting power saver mode, and trying with wired headphones and regular phone speakers. Spotify premium family account. PC works normally.",NEGATIVE
It's awesome we can heare so many songs at best quality,POSITIVE
Very relaxing specially the old music,POSITIVE
Spotify has become my sole music player app because of the playlists I have made.,POSITIVE
Very Happy With Spotify,POSITIVE
Absolutely love Spotify gotta be the best music app on the planet,POSITIVE
I've been using Spotify for a couple of years now and it's good. but still a little bit upset that there is no podcasts funtion.,NEGATIVE
"I have be on Spotify for quite some time. I downloaded the app to continue to listen to my music without having to be on my computer most of the time. As I'm writing this, I am listing through every Dean Martin album. But with the shuffle on, I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT IN ORDER. And I'm not buying premium since the free account is fine with me. But if you pushing me to buy it? Think again. Fix this BS please.",NEGATIVE
"This app is amazing,I easy get lyrics of the songs",POSITIVE
Wonderful more music than I had even imagined â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"Amazing, pick ur favorite song Artist..",POSITIVE
Brilliant and easy to use,POSITIVE
Love it got all the songs that you want to hear very good relaxing not too many commercials I recommend this all my friends,POSITIVE
"I use this app at work, but the bass is too loud and almost overlaps the sound completely. I've looked for an equalizer in the settings, but there isn't one, and I have googled it several times. It says there is supposed to be an equalizer available.",NEGATIVE
Why can't I choose the order of my music? I came here to listen to ONE MUSICAL and I can't even listen to it right without Premium. Forget this; I'm using a different app.,NEGATIVE
It's a good app I just hate that I have a playlist and I try playing it and it only gives u the option of shuffle play and then sometimes it plays music that's not even in my playlist and it gets annoying and the limited skips is very irritating,NEGATIVE
Sometimes its stopped playing after the ad,NEGATIVE
"I've been a Spotify premium member for over 6 years. Won't ever use another music streaming service, and I love the features Spotify has to offer, as well as exclusive podcasts!",POSITIVE
Best music & podcast App hands down,NEGATIVE
Great! So easy to navigate and select the music you want,POSITIVE
"Loved the app for a while, then I opened it to listen to my Playlist and the app no longer let's me play that Playlist and it added a bunch of songs to it. Mildly disappointed.",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify when I pull up an artist I hear music from them on Spotify that I never knew they had. I recommend everyone to download this music app. Way to go Spotify,POSITIVE
Something is wrong with my playlist i try to play the song and it just starts from random place and it is like a small trailer.,NEGATIVE
Trying Spotify for the first time. I've been trying Pandora also. Need to load my phone with some music to have when hiking outside WiFi zone.,NEGATIVE
I love the many podcast selections,POSITIVE
It's free it's a lot easier to find your music it has a lot more music than some music videos on YouTube YouTube doesn't have all of the music that Spotify has so I encourage you to get Spotify if you want to listen to just like your music right away because you can pick out what you want out of it just so much easier than going to YouTube I already knows what you want to watch because you pick it out at the beginning,POSITIVE
Personally my experience is been good but recently evry time i start a song pause or a next song starts my phone shuts off and it's very annoying please fix this Spotify,NEGATIVE
Probably a favorite of many today 2022 the music and artists are easy to find and the selection and prices are reasonable,POSITIVE
It has every song you could possibly want and more.,POSITIVE
"Honestly, there are songs that are definitely missing, but it's my Go-To for my music!!",NEGATIVE
I hope to make it in this glorious place. Thank you Spotify for being fair.,POSITIVE
"Ads, really annoying but fair enough I suppose it's free. But... I added some songs to a playlist and got a bunch of songs I didn't want suggested by Spotify. I deleted them from the playlist and Spotify replaced them with some different ones then played those instead of the ones I chose and wouldn't let me skip them unless I'm a premium user. Well I tell you what I'm not going to be any kind of user. Uninstalled.",NEGATIVE
"Almost every single time I adjust the volume while connected to something via Bluetooth, it resets my equalizer causing the volume to skyrocket until I open up the equalizer when it finally goes back to what it was set at. Beyond annoying and infuriating. Doesn't deserve more than 1 star until fixed.",NEGATIVE
even without premium the app works amazing,POSITIVE
"It's fine apart from the amount of ads and how it adds things to your playlist. I would also love if they added more songs ESPECIALLY slowed and sped up versions. It would definitely make the platform better, and more popular.",POSITIVE
"One of the best music apps, sound quality is perfect and functionality is flawless.",POSITIVE
Very nice selection of music,POSITIVE
I had a genre on my playlist that I really liked and wanted to go and listen to that genre in my liked playlist and found that the genre has disappeared. Even though I know I have that genre of music in my liked songs playlist. It's disappointing and discouraging that I can't find all my songs in that genre anymore. I might delete the app because of it.,NEGATIVE
Really enjoying this app ðŸ¤© the music is good,POSITIVE
"Keeps stopping on my Google home mini for no reason , looks as though it's still playing on the app. Factory reset, re installed and still only getting maybe a minute or two if music before it stops. Seems I'm paying premium for a third rate service",NEGATIVE
So much to selected from and share. Family package at a great price.,POSITIVE
It was such a good music listening app but now after every 2 songs ad comes ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
When u play a song I want it changes it 1 start only this app is trash,NEGATIVE
Simply the best online music player,POSITIVE
"I have had Spotify since 2016 and love, love, LOVE IT. Best thing I've wasted years of money on. Lol.",POSITIVE
Everytime I slide to the side it always come to BTS song I mean what the heck I want to listen to playlist that I has create not the BTS song everytime I slide to the side it always BTS BTS BTS so it now I feel like I want to uninstall it can you just fix it or something even i try to listen to daily mix song that have no k pop song at all and I slide to the side BTS song come out again again and again it plz I beg fix it before i uninstall it. TQ,NEGATIVE
excellent music app,POSITIVE
Thank you Spotify you are definitely better than the rest.,POSITIVE
The app freezes a lot. Overall since paying for the family plan it feels like and the audio continously cuts out when answering phone calls. Tech support takes forever to answer and gives you simple fixes or work arounds that either don't work or you've already tried even if you told them it doesn't work. I'd gladly pay more to switch to a better music app. The algorithm only plays about50 or so songs even if you have 2k liked songs you'll never hear most of them without specifically searching,NEGATIVE
UPDATE: The issue has been resolved. Thank you.,POSITIVE
Great music and great experience,POSITIVE
The best app ever on music experience,POSITIVE
No issues. Lightweight app,POSITIVE
Worst app in the history of the world. Skips ahead to different podcasts mid episode...and that was even while paying for Premium,NEGATIVE
"Great music app. The ads can be bothersome but premium settles that issue. Great catalog of artists and podcasts. Also great that I can use it on my PS4, pc and phone.",POSITIVE
"Awesome ðŸ‘, all ways improving. Just make sure you look after the artist's that give us the good sounds.",POSITIVE
Fazool app hai. Without internet chl hi ni sakti ya app to faida. Is sy bhtr bnda YouTube sy songs sun ly. Baat to aik hi hai. Na hi download ki option hai. Na save ki option hai k banda save krky baad mai hi sun ly.,NEGATIVE
Good listening pleasure and connectivity,POSITIVE
Good app almost every single song in the world and no adds.,POSITIVE
"Great when it works. Been a subscriber for many years but lately the app takes forever to load. Even after clearing cache, re-installing, etc. My go-to music app these days is YouTube music which is way more consistent...for me, at least.",NEGATIVE
The app doesnt let me play music when i go into a artist it doesnt show the artists songs,NEGATIVE
Just updated this and now none of my saved Playlists are there,NEGATIVE
Very clear sound Spotify is good app and world number one app,POSITIVE
I love this app but recently i got logged out by mistake and it's not logging me in again i even tried reinstalling and all stuff but nothing worked.,NEGATIVE
"Good app, my constant. but a lot of ads ...and on a serious note i will suggest the team to update with a feature of *shuffle play* on playlists too and also to provide 4+ pins on profile.",POSITIVE
Was great until recent updates now my enhanced feature has disappeared and I can't get it back after trying everything in Spotify forum to restore it. Paying for a premium feature that I can't even use,NEGATIVE
Great platform for music,POSITIVE
"Spotify had absolutely tanked. Why am I, a paying customer who PAYS for NO ads, GETTING ADS?? What is the point? The app continually glitches, has always given me trouble when I want to download podcasts and just crashes (even after clearing cache, force quitting, and restarting my device). It's absolutley terrible and I really hope they fix this soon or I'm switching back to YouTube once I'm fed up with it.",NEGATIVE
They changed the now playing back thank God!! Old review: Why change the now playing page UI and take away the lyrics button? What backwards A/B testing is this???,NEGATIVE
They charged me multiple times without my permission and I am still trying to get my money back. Don't trust a free trial from this app I will update when (if) I get reimbursed. I did not even use the app while I was being charged.,NEGATIVE
I love the broad variety of the music selection. It's rare for them to not have the songs you're looking for. Definitely a worthy add.,POSITIVE
Had it for awhile but now i can't use it. i listen to one song and then the app loses itself and refuses to open. Waste of time.,NEGATIVE
"Its a great app, but I sadly don't want to spend my money on premium. I wish i could listen to music off of wifi too. Could Spotify make it an option for people to download music without premium? The times that I need my music the most is when I am outside or at the basketball court. @Spotify please respond to this review. I promise I will give you five stars if you make it possible to download music for people without premium.",POSITIVE
I will give it 3 stars because there is lots of ads between the song.But it is nice app,POSITIVE
"This app used to be fine, but now I can't even play music from my Playlist because all it does is show me previews of music I already have.",NEGATIVE
"Little or no adds,better than u- tube",NEGATIVE
Spotify is an amazing app to download. It provides great service and it has all of the music you can think of. There is next to none adds. It's a wonderful app and I recommend it to everyone.,POSITIVE
"You people are full of sht I select a song and you play your own song, making it impossible for me to play a song that I want",NEGATIVE
"Stop asking me to turn on Bluetooth every time I open the app, I don't use it!",NEGATIVE
At first I signed up for the music. Then I found the podcasts. Great variaty. Something for eveyone.,POSITIVE
"I rlly love spotify but recently the ads are getting excessive, I was supposed to get ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" and got 3 ads after 1 song?? non premium users deserve more </3",NEGATIVE
"There is way to many ads. But other than that, it's pretty decent for listening to music. I figured it's much better on computers or chromebooks than on phones. On computers you can choose songs you wanna play, and there is a reasonable amount of ads. Sure Spotify can be annoying, but it is good for music.",POSITIVE
"Great app! Whether its tracking down nearly forgotten songs, seeing what favorite artists are up to, or finding great songs and artists I didn't know! Of course its also awesome at play lists for your fave artists and genres.",POSITIVE
I love the music but not the ads if u are not premium ðŸ¥²,NEGATIVE
If you are a music lover then this app is best for youâ¤â¤,POSITIVE
this app was fine..even the free version.. until whatever updates googles been pushing lately cuz its my google apps that seem to have started using AI.. my apps all of a sudden gained total access and functions on my phone..spotify has given itself the ability to turn off my wifi.. pretend to be other apps.. and especially when im in my car..it goes nuts.. not playing anything i like is the least of it.. it will speed up or slow down an episode.. it will stop and start playing random stuff,NEGATIVE
"Best, most advanced music platform for sure, it's just the way to go and super pleasing to look at, use, works with everything, Spotify ftw",POSITIVE
I love Spotify but there seems to be an issue casting podcasts to Alexa devices and I feel its entirely based on advertising revenue - podcasts cast to Alexa devices didn't play ads. Sort this out so I can cast without ads - I have a premium account so I shouldn't have ads anyway - and it's a five star review again.,NEGATIVE
"Switched from Google/YouTube music to this and have to say it's so underwhelming. Really buggy app, takes ages to open, cuts out randomly, if signal drops to half then music stops. Can't see what the hype is about at all.",NEGATIVE
It's different and better than Amazon music that you literally pay twice for I don't get it pay for prime get some music add unlimited and get all music dumb. I pay one set price and get the same stuff here on Spotify.,POSITIVE
"I love using spotify, It is the best music site I have come across in my 13 years of looking for a music site. There are a few adds on free trial but the site is other wise amazing. ðŸ˜»",POSITIVE
"It's free, has the music I like, there are a lot of commercials but they gotta pay their bills too, so not gonna hate on them for it. Overall pretty satisfied.",NEGATIVE
"Am trying to subscribe to the premium package,I find it difficult to make a payment.",NEGATIVE
"The apps keeps crashing for some reason. Also account got data breached last time, talk about broken security.",NEGATIVE
The user interface is dang good. Sound quality ain't too bad,POSITIVE
"The play bar in the bottom of the app constantly disappears after changing apps, while the music continues to play. The same goes for the notification controls. Samsung S21 Ultra, Android 12",NEGATIVE
Darn Spotify really need a undo button for accidentally unliked a song!!!,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the one app I use religiously.,NEGATIVE
"The lyrics don't show up for me! I've uninstalled the app and cleared the cache many times, but it didn't help! Please fix it!!! Update: I updated the creators and after few days it finally worked!!!âœ¨",NEGATIVE
"I like this app It have all types of songs Like party,lofi,pop,soft Types of songs So i like this app I have give â­â­â­â­â­star and i also like the sound quality that is cool ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
"I can't even open my liked songs list, please fix this already!!",NEGATIVE
The update earlier this year has stopped connecting to my car stereo Spotify app. This was the main reason I went with Spotify and the stereo. The unit is a pioneer MVH-X580DAB. I have since updated the firmware and it is not that. After doing some research it appears to be a common problem with different stereos. I don't just want to roll back my Spotify app. I would like it to be fixed. Or do I go back to amazon?,NEGATIVE
"Why there is two copies of same song, ut confuses a lot...When im shuffle playing songs that i like it plays same songs everytime, dont know how their shuffle works cause i am hearing 10-12 songs everyday again and again which teases me a lot.....do something fix it improve it...",POSITIVE
I love this app and the variety of music and podcast it provides â¤,POSITIVE
Amazing all throughout Except for sound quality. Highest quality should be highest that the headphones and phone can handle. Not what spotify can provide. Need different audio codec support too. Listening to low-end quality (compared to LDAC's limits) music on LDAC is virtually the same to high-end quality on SBC (Standard Bluetooth Connection),NEGATIVE
"Easy to use, has everything i search for and i listen to some pretty small metal bands, premium is great ðŸ‘Œ",POSITIVE
Works very good but missing some functions.,NEGATIVE
I really enjoy Spotify over Pandora.....,POSITIVE
"Good app,but adds are annoying.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is always on time,NEGATIVE
"Well so far since I got the opportunity to use spotify it has been a blast to go on saying I didn't even know where I was heading with it, but for me it's really great that I was able to have an account with spotify and that makes me feel more confident about the future of its live streaming. ðŸ‘Œ",POSITIVE
Commercials all over the place,NEGATIVE
"DONT LIKE NEW GOAST LIKE VERSION I CANT SEE IT ðŸ˜” SET IT BACK GREEN HILIGHTED VEERSION .GOAST IS TERRIBLE,NOW MY CATIGORY DISPLAY IS MISSING.LEAVE THINGS ALONE! PUT IT BACK. DAMM JUST COZE IM WHITE HUH!!!!",NEGATIVE
"Video doesn't work correctly on tablet. When I try to go full screen when watching a video podcast, the video only takes up the right half of the screen. In the past the video would take up the full screen. I also have issues with the app freezing and having to restart while using on a tablet.",NEGATIVE
Super app it recommended song which suits our mood,POSITIVE
Great playlist and great quality sound,POSITIVE
Great songs in good quality,POSITIVE
So brilliant pick artist press on the artist u good to go,POSITIVE
"Listen to what I want when I want. I get to make my own play list, I'm my own DJ. Saves me on long family trips as well ðŸ˜‰",POSITIVE
I have all my fav song in seconds love this app ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
"What the is happening with this app???!!!?? The songs are playing very very half like what is going on??!!! You literally need to put shuffle on that I don't want too.. I'm just getting so angry I also updated it but still nothing happened??!!?,ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡This app has become very disgusting cuz now I can't play my favourite part of the song nor listen to it easily F- Spotify you better reply Plz plz fixx this",NEGATIVE
"Absolute rubbish. Can't play separate songs on my phone but I can in my tablet and computer, automatically adds songs to playlists and you can't take them off, or even see the unwanted songs, have to shuffle through all the unwanted stuff to find your actual playlist, and then has the nerve to remind to edit the playlist. Please change it back to how it was before, or just improve it. Do not download. Spotify has been ruined (especially on a Samsung phone).",NEGATIVE
Pay $15 for premium to have many issues. Offline songs don't load and app crashes frequently.,NEGATIVE
Good music app and i love it just add more music for more better in a future,POSITIVE
When I press on a playlist it starts playing a suggested song even when I turned off autoplay. I made more playlists to switch because of the suggested songs. Now when I click on any of the playlists it starts playing a random song. I am very frusted with this and don't like this feature.,NEGATIVE
I like music and playing games so I can do that with this app,POSITIVE
Helps my mental health more than you will ever know.,POSITIVE
"I love it but it would be better if you could turn off the suggested songs, because sometimes I just want to listen to just my playlists",POSITIVE
Spotify please give me back the steampunk playlist I'm begging you it was so good,POSITIVE
Any song you want its all here in spotify!,NEGATIVE
"I've been using Spotify premium for more than five years now and it has always been my favourite music app, but now it is so buggy I can't use it anymore. I am considering to cancel it. 1. I can't remove song from my liked songs list 2. sometimes songs I select just get skipped 3. Offline mode is almost impossible to be used because the songs just don't play 4. Song radio doesn't work Please fix it, otherwise it is not worth it anymore",NEGATIVE
Good app easy to use not too many ads.,POSITIVE
Bad interface design. Hard to navigate and not intuitive.,NEGATIVE
I know without premium there are many ads but the fact that this is an amazing app for listening songs,POSITIVE
"Premium User here! I'd like you to be able to LOCK the darn queue, I mean everytime im building it up, ONE &$&%&@ slip and u skip through it! Like what was the point of it all? Also be able to view the lyrics without having to click the &$^@% songs...but maybe im just still heated about the other problem. Or add a 'build queue & make into playlist' feature. But please fix this queue thing...its janky and loose.",NEGATIVE
Stupid adverts when trying to listen to music,NEGATIVE
"It's a good app, but the ads are sometimes annoying. Also it lags a lot, i don't know if my WiFi or my phone is the problem, but yeah overall good app.",POSITIVE
Great music app!,POSITIVE
Love the sound and my smooth jazz,POSITIVE
I love all the song collections and it's user friendly considering an a senior citizen.lol,POSITIVE
"Since your last update, I can't get ANY music to play. The ads, however, come through brilliantly ðŸ‘ Good job! Hope you know sarcasm when you hear it because I am disgusted with this whole thing. I have a feeling if I upgrade to premium and start giving you $ it would work. This is BS!!",NEGATIVE
Good music Sound are clear,POSITIVE
"The advertisements state that you get an ad once every half an hour. It's more like every ten minutes. And it won't be one or two ads. It isn't unusual to get three ads in a row. Usually, they last about 30 seconds each. Even more so: it'll play four or five songs in your playlist and then it'll go on to play something entirely different. It won't even fit the genre you were listening to before. Very frustrating.",NEGATIVE
"Good, but crashes when I open the podcast menu for the first time in a while. When I open the app again, it's fixed but it's a slight annoyance.",NEGATIVE
"Been a subscriber for years, I love it. Appreciate all the specific playlist curating they do for you specifically. I also really appreciate the privating of playlists, not everyone needs to know what songs I cry to on the reg.",POSITIVE
"Several years using the app. It's had its ups & downs throughout the years with adding or removing features; of which your happiness or disappointment would be relative. As an objective review... The app does 100% what it's supposed to do... play music! It does it well, and there are some great features available for those with a premium subscription. Including... no shuffling, playing specific songs or albums, downloading those songs for offline listening, and of course... no ads. YMMV",POSITIVE
Nice sound quality..,POSITIVE
"Great for creating your custom playlist, but Pandora has a bigger playlist repertoire. After a few likes, the daily mixes all become the same and it gets monotonous.",NEGATIVE
Best music player app.. Thanks Spotify! Good job ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Researching Physics of Universe proved Gravitational system of Universe is absolutely to be WRONG . PROVED Experimentally and Mathematically. Researching 1958 to up to date. Now I am 78 years old. K.G.,NEGATIVE
"I use spotify everyday, its my favourite music streaming platform. ðŸ’¯",POSITIVE
Got 6 ads in a row but good service,POSITIVE
"The phone app continues to crash when loading the feed and when starting a podcast. ""Turning it off and on again,"" is not a solution for a company that has the resources to secure exclusivity contracts of the largest names in the podcast space. Fix the software. The smart TV app is even more disappointing, still no video for podcasts uploaded with video.",NEGATIVE
Spotify keeps stopping despite carrying out all the suggestions on the spotify website to prevent this. Will scrap my premium membership if this continues.,NEGATIVE
Excellent music player,POSITIVE
"App is great, iam not a premium member so there are ads",NEGATIVE
Overall it's grand but when you go to edit you have to drag song to the top rather than order as recently added etc. Terrible change on Samsung,NEGATIVE
App works great. Music is great ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¾,POSITIVE
I am totally into Spottify and I love the mini premium of 7 and 25 ....worth this was first.But now app not responding at all tried lal the trouble shoots since I gave trial for free premium it's not working... Don't know whether it's a trick,NEGATIVE
(premium user) what's the point of downloading songs and whatnot if the app can't even load the playlist when my cell service is less then perfect,NEGATIVE
Best streaming service,POSITIVE
"Spotify Premium user for several years now, app quality seems to consistently get worse over time. Queued songs duplicating, said duplicates deleting queued songs, random songs being added to the queue, shuffle isn't great, etc.",NEGATIVE
It will not play unless player is open. Where are the player controls??? I've been a PREMIUM FAMILY SUBSCRIBER FOR 10 YEARS.,NEGATIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
The songs are not playing. It shows the playlist is empty for all the album.,NEGATIVE
"I've only had Spotify Music for since Dec 2021...., I had premium YouTube since 2018, and I just previously cancelled it last week, umm that pretty much says it all, BUT there's a couple of issues I have I spent hour's n hours getting my playlists n 1 day I felt like listening to latest hit playlist of Country music n for some reason had vanished from my play list and 2nd when I push play on random by the time you reach the 5th song you hear first song play again, it just doesn't play randomðŸ˜”",NEGATIVE
Spotify is a good app but the fact you can't turn off shuffle and keeps playing different songs is really annoying if you are gonna it that way count me out,NEGATIVE
This app is amazing . I can find Every song exist . And one thing that this is add free . Add free music at free of cost .,POSITIVE
"You are good In music,you know music and you provide music for the best listeners",POSITIVE
"Things that have been broken in the app for years still not fixed. They are constantly rolling out changes, but it seems not ones that actually fix the bugs I keep seeing. Patronizing responses and closed threads in support.",NEGATIVE
"It keeps losing track of itself. Plays music when its paused, sometimes plats music without the abulity to pause (no status bar).",NEGATIVE
Phone app keeps waking my pc up?? Also connecting to Chromecast audio is always a lottery. Annoying.,NEGATIVE
Give us better widget support already,NEGATIVE
Spotify is much better than resso other song app â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Best music app in the world,POSITIVE
I absolutely love my Spotify,POSITIVE
"So I have problem with ""Slow down! Only 6 skips per hour!"" AND YOU ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO EXIT THE SONG AND PICK THE ONE YOU WANT TO HEAR! Can you fix this? IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE SONGS THAT I LIKE!",NEGATIVE
I love this app so much I listen song for 3hours a day But they should add all types of songs including remixes,POSITIVE
Nice songs available,POSITIVE
"The app is great but sometimes I'm indecisive of what I want to listen to, I just want to listen to something. Can you maybe add a button like the one netflix has (surprise me) or something. That would be really great especially if it plays something related to the kind of music we listen to. Wonderful app nevertheless.",POSITIVE
"Great, it plays music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ Thanks ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜Š ðŸ«‚ ðŸ™ ..",POSITIVE
I really hate this app because it always play random song and when I turn off the auto play it still play random song just fix it.,NEGATIVE
I hate how you can't pick your own song and how it picks for you,NEGATIVE
"Please, fix thisðŸ˜­, I can't even play a single FULL SONG, everytime I click on that particular song, it only has it's trailer or it only plays about 10 seconds of the whole song. Plus I can't play my playlist because of that shuffle button...I swear... I'm crying my balls out for not figuring how to play a song.. its- it's really really really difficult to use this app especially as a non-premium user... I'm looking forward to a better version of this appðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",NEGATIVE
"Autoplay won't turn off so I have to listen to unrelated, random music instead of the next episode of a podcast. Please fix this issue.",NEGATIVE
"as of the last 4 years ive just been using a jail broken spotify for a multitude of reasons 1: only being allowed shuffle play on a non premium account 2: i get up to 4 ads every 10 minutes, which is unnacceptable even if u need them to make profit 3: 6 skips a hour is revolting 4: the dont play this again feature does not work",NEGATIVE
Very nice music app,POSITIVE
App is horrible. Won't stop asking me about Bluetooth. To select a JRE episode I have to scroll forever then tap it you can't hit play from the search engine you'll tap it and it does nothing. Been an issue for around a year or more lol,NEGATIVE
Seriously... Where is the sort option? First you remove the playlist song order editing option. Now we can't even sort songs in album or artist order. change that and it'll be better,NEGATIVE
I would give it all stars if THIS NEW UPDATE WAS GOOD. I hate the new update in which the songs are randomized and i cant just choose them like the pervious update and all the albums in my library. I just hate the new update of the app. P.S make a option to choose randomized or normal please,NEGATIVE
Worthless on phone.,NEGATIVE
Been on Spotify for years and years never had an issue and has every song you'll ever want,POSITIVE
More advertisement while hearing songs,NEGATIVE
"I can't listen to 3 songs in a row without getting MULTIPLE 30 UNSKIPPABLE ADS, The amount of ads are absolutely insane, I remember when I used to be able to listen to a whole playlist and only get like 3 or 4 ads, now I can listen to 3 songs with out getting 5 ads, the ads are stupid long and not to mention it takes time to load the next songs so I sit there for a good 2 minutes waiting for more music! Im only giving it 2 stars because I like the people on the app, NOT THE ONES BEHIND IT!!!!!!!",NEGATIVE
Love that you can hear alot of different kinds of songs but after a while it stops working and says no internet connection but the internet's working I then have to delete it and reinstall it,NEGATIVE
One of the best app and please stop adds and we want lyrics for all songs ðŸŽµ â¤,POSITIVE
"Thankyou Spotify for being here with me all the time I really appreciate your activeness you are so much mean to me. Your app also gives good quality to my musics. But I just wanna add more, I want to add some lyrics on my Spotify even if I'm offline or not in in my internet because it will help that much. Thankyou again!!â¤ï¸",POSITIVE
"Honestly it would've been a 4 if the number of times my payments were rejected, kind of irritating",NEGATIVE
"I miss the shuffle play button, it should be an option for customized playlists.",NEGATIVE
These is just really good that I don't even have words for it,POSITIVE
I love listening to music on it,POSITIVE
"I love spotify, but only because i have premium, it isnt good without premium, not because of ads but because of the limited skips and the fact that you cant listen to individual songs.",NEGATIVE
I like it very much One of the best thing about it is that you can listen any thing If you're playing any game then gaming playlist are available and if you're studying or doing homework then study playlist is there,POSITIVE
"I can't replay the song I want to listen, I can't play from a earlier point, and the app randomly shuffles songs which I didn't even ask for. I'm searching to listen to a track, and the app is playing a whole playlist on it's own, and the playlist doesn't even start with my desired song. I also don't find the shuffle on/of button anymore, so I am not being able to turn off shuffle. Dunno what happened, the app was working just fine till yesterday. Anyways, it's annoying me, I'm quitting.",NEGATIVE
I think it has good songs but I would like to see more Friday night funking ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"I really enjoy listening to music,but the thing that annoys me SO much are the ads. I don't wanna pay to listen to music without ads .. I honestly like the way you have y'alls playlist's listed and arranged. I'd have a better experience if there was ""less"" ads . No ads would be awesome! But I'd like less ads.. You can listen to this music on any app, sometimes it pauses. Which ..is good! But back to the positivity..I love listening to the music while half asleep. So relaxing lol! Overall,lovee!",POSITIVE
This is an awesome app I can listen to My fav songsâ™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡,POSITIVE

"You know, I liked choosing my own songs to listen to, as well as skipping those I choose to skip, but if you not even gonna allow me to do that and even put a damn limit on the amount of skips I have per hour you can go f--k yourselves",NEGATIVE
This app is amazing... Can get any song you can think of... And best experience too.,POSITIVE
Spotify just help me in concentrating on Studies and whenever I bored I just use this app and play my playlist but I am giving it 4 stars because some songs which were in spotify are deleted so must say that spotify should do something about it....,NEGATIVE
'Music is a therapy and spotify is the best therapist'.....â¤ï¸âœ¨ðŸ‘‘,POSITIVE

"I love spotify :D, but I got a new phone I forgot my password log in details, joys of mental health. :( But I tried to set up a new one and needed to cancel the payment in the bank I forget what payment was called but It wasn't a direct debit so I couldn't cancel it. To reset it up if I did I would block it for life. I couldn't find anyway of contacting anyone to sort this out and am still paying Â£13.99 through the bank. I am on the free service when it ends I will have to change provider. :(",NEGATIVE
Overall great experience. Shuffle feature could be a bit more intuitive. Would be a 5* otherwise.,NEGATIVE
This is very nice application because with the help of this we can hear song and do our work also,POSITIVE
Keep up the awesome work! ðŸ˜âœŒï¸ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
I have a suggestion for this app. If you can have something to customize the home screen and change preferences that should do. The premium Plans are useful for uninterrupted listening.,NEGATIVE
"Good sound quality, collection ok but unfortunately Indian collection is not enough, ad shows too much, Premium membership too much costly",NEGATIVE
Thi app is straight garbage it doesn't allow me to listen to my favorite songs now it literally gives me a preview an when I go to find them it shows the album but with no song an only lyrics plz undo update or change this thank you andim not keeping ur app its getting deleted.,NEGATIVE

The music and sound is great but so many advertisements,POSITIVE
"I've been using this app since the start of a year listening to some new podcasts that aren't on YouTube. It's been wonderful, and I'd love to rate this as 5 stars. But since the last update I did as of today, for some reason it won't work! I've got full bars on wifi and I even tried on my data connection as well and nothing. All it says is ""check your connection and try again"". If anyone else has this problem, let me know if you fixed it.",NEGATIVE
"Won't stop forceclosing throughout the day, can't send feedback and skips to random podcasts or terrible music in the middle of the one I'm already listening to. Re-download, clear cache and data? Yea did nothing... Bad internet? Nope, great signal. Can't find anything useful in the settings. Definitely won't buy premium.",NEGATIVE
"Last time I looked at my likes playlist, I had 711 songs. But today I look and it says I only have 685. Why have songs been removed?",NEGATIVE
This app i amazing ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ i love it but I can't unhide me hidden songs please fix it,POSITIVE
"Have discovered so much new music since joining Spotify, without a doubt my favourite app.",POSITIVE
Honestly haven't had any problems with the app had it now for 2 or years so far so good,POSITIVE
I Love Spotify radio so much!! ðŸ“»,POSITIVE
The app is going great until it's updated I don't want to be rude but can you please bring back the old Spotify.,POSITIVE
Why I gave Spotify 4 stars is because it doesn't let me play the songs I want to hear and I hate that,NEGATIVE
"Awesome. Way better than I tunes, Deezer, youtube and has remained on point with each update.",POSITIVE
Sound quality is better other than,POSITIVE
This is my favorite app because there are available all kinds of song,POSITIVE
"I like Spotify, but there are some big intentional issues. You need spotify premium to do almost anything. I have also noticed that Spotify will play music that you are more likely to skip, rather the music that you want to hear. I hate that you need to pay 6.99 euros just to listen to a song of your choice. Overall, this app is rather useless without any kind of payment, imagine it like EA.",NEGATIVE
It's good over all but i searched for few songs which weren't there. If that problem is fixed it will just be very fine.,POSITIVE
I like it and I rate it 3 out 5 but i am not able to pay for premium and i dont know what seems to be the problem can i get a solution to it asap ?,NEGATIVE
"Sick of it crashing or not finishing a podcast and skipping to the next, uninstalling.",NEGATIVE
Very good app. So many songs available. Thanks!,POSITIVE
Awesome to be your own DJ and choose your favourite tracks to play.,POSITIVE
I had a suggestion to remove the ads,NEGATIVE
"so im giving it 2 star because the new thing where you only get 6 skips per hour and can't go back is just annoying me so much like why please revert it back i don't like this at all i cant even afford premium, just please fix this i don't like this :/",NEGATIVE
"Really nice app ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°,,, but sometimes it creates a little problem ...... after playing the playlist sometimes it stops and again I have to play the playlist ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ",NEGATIVE
It only plays one part of the songs on my liked list and it says watch this video to get 30 min of uninterrupted listing but then they make me listen to another ad,NEGATIVE
Not letting me play songs on when click shuffle,NEGATIVE
"I have purchased premium plan however, i am getting low volume quality song.",NEGATIVE
I have found the bug in your application when dark mode activate that time the timing line didn't come,NEGATIVE

Pretty Awesome ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ some new songs not on this there on YouTube though hopefully we will see the new songs come to this app it rocks and has Joe Rogen so I'm a customer always thanks Spotify!!!ðŸ™,POSITIVE
It crashes midway through a song sometimes but honestly having all my favorite music(except a few) in one place is worth the minor annoyance.,POSITIVE
"I Just Love This App!!!!! I changed my rating from 5 to 1, due to the fact that All of the songs I downloaded, I need to redownload to listen to them before I go offline!!! Had 5,000+ songs downloaded on my phone, now I need to redownload it to have it again!!! Only to have it removed, after paying for my monthly membership!!! Don't even mention the time I have to waste redownloading, but I also need to pay for the data transfer on my Wi-Fi, over and over again!!!",NEGATIVE
I love listening to song and I have tried music app from lot but none provide features like spotify..!! Thanks Spotify for providing us this music platform âœ¨â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
"Great, easy to find artists and new music",POSITIVE

Absolutely love this app. My number 1 choice when it comes to my music which I take very seriously!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ’¯ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥ðŸŽµðŸŽšðŸŽ›ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¤,POSITIVE
I don't like it I want to play one of my playlist but it just plays random music that I are not in my playlist and I also can't replay songs it is glitchy and it's a mess I only use it to listen to podcasts,NEGATIVE
It's very useful and mind blowing app. I enjoy it always.,POSITIVE
"So far the best app that I've used for streaming music!! Has an awesome library of artists and some from which you could easily pick sms choose the ones you wanna listen to and even a personalized mix which is great. Thank you for being one amount the few that honor artists their hardwork. I respect that! I'm yet to subscribe for the Premium, but I'll definitely write a review then",POSITIVE
Overall good app for songs,POSITIVE
"I downloaded this app because a friend told me about a couple of albums he found. So far I'm not impressed and will probably remove it soon if I can't stop certain things from happening. First, I opened a song as a test. Now every time I open my tablet that song is showing as a notification. I can't seem to get rid of it. This is beyond annoying. Second, it has linked to every device in my house. I only want my TV and tablet, nothing else.",NEGATIVE
"Settings for not work, have the setting turned off where spotify add song that are similar yet they still play getting annoyed of listening to bands o don't want to hear. I made a Playlist to listen. To what I want to hear not your suggestions.",NEGATIVE
Been a very nice music app that so far has every song and/or artist that I've searched and played. Very good would recommend it ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"I have the free version and it is absolute garbage, I can't play the tracks I select, it just plays suggested songs often from artists I would never listen to, sticking with Soundcloud",NEGATIVE
awesome app just wish i didnt need premium for normal functions,POSITIVE
"Before I loved this app but after the recent update I can't do anything. If I try to do anything but look at the home page, I get the message to check my internet connection despite being connected. No other apps are having issues and I've tried everything all the way to a hard reset of the phone. Nothing works. So get it or don't. But be prepared to delete it just in case. Switching to another app myself",NEGATIVE
Great app to listen to mdu favorite music. Simple and premium price is affordable. Sound quality is fantastic. Its a great feature that we can download songs. Also i have a suggetion to add playback speed buttona,POSITIVE
Songs collection is good really great aap/before i use wynk music/jio savan,POSITIVE
Been using you guys for years now. One thing i would recommend was a lock on your songs so you dont accidently swipe and erase them ive done it alot.,NEGATIVE
Imagine coming from Apple Music only to find out Spotify doesn't have lyrics?????ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸,NEGATIVE
"Great, but the add lower the quality",NEGATIVE
App crashes every time I open it after recent update. Works ok when I reopen it.,NEGATIVE

Overall experience is good my liked songs play from there playlist once finished i thought it would play the next song i liked.,POSITIVE
"This app doesn't seem to like other apps, so frequently while the podcasts still play, I can't control the playback or forward. I end up having to restart or reinstall.",NEGATIVE
Excellent music app!! Couldn't be more happy with it ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ Recommendable 100%,POSITIVE
Getting really tired of Spotify not loading any downloaded music while I'm offline with no internet connection. Many times i work in an environment with absolutely no cell service and I cannot play downloaded music.,NEGATIVE
The app has gone down hill over the last year. Almost constant annoying little issues that add up. Lol it has actually gotten worse! Dont subscribe,NEGATIVE
Will not let me listen to my playlist with out adding other songs to my playlist.,NEGATIVE
Horrible. Uninstalled. You cant even listened to the song you like unless you played all the song they will first gave you.,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify. Try it and tell me you don't like it!,NEGATIVE
A very nice app. I am going to give four stars because one problem is there in this app that we can't download any song but the app is out standing.,NEGATIVE
This is by far my favorite music app ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"New UI looks sleek but the lyrics powered by Musixmatch it's not synchronised correctly even though the sync timing is correct on the desktop version and in Musixmatch itself. Adding Oled Dark Mode (Pitch Black), dark mode (The Usual) and light mode (System White) would also be great.",NEGATIVE
ads really sucks,NEGATIVE
"I love it. I love how I can sync with my PC. And one place for all my music. It found every song I wanted. Only problem is if I try to play a specific song, it plays random songs instead. Otherwise 5* product.",POSITIVE
Do not get this app unless you have the money to get premium every month because everytime you make a playlist they feel the need to add 30 songs that you don't like so please only get this if you have money to get premium,NEGATIVE
I haven't had any trouble finding the music just finding the right app for the sound and base boost got the X BOOSTER but still does pretty good.,POSITIVE
"constant crashing, NOT WORTH IT",NEGATIVE
Great songs. Easy to set up playlist. Low data setting is very low usage,NEGATIVE
Great app if you have premium...,POSITIVE
Playlists are good. Auto Play of songs is awesome features because it plays automatically the best songs.,POSITIVE
"A very good app, the ads are not too overwhelming, and I like being able to get good music onto easy to make playlists. However, I hate that songs I didn't ask for are added to MY playlist. I end up listening to songs I don't like and can't skip more than my actual music. Sure this my be a nudge to premium, but I feel this addition on mobile may cause for less people even attempting to listen here. Other than that an amazing app!!",NEGATIVE
I been on Spotify for years. Continue to build with multiple classics...,POSITIVE
This is my only music and podcast app.,NEGATIVE
"I like it but I'd like it better if there will be romanized lyrics in foreign song like Korean,Thai,and Japanese",POSITIVE
It's the best thing to listen to when your alone,POSITIVE
"The best vibes are found on spotify, download and enjoy !!!",POSITIVE
Its a very nice app but I cant change what I'm playing on my phone yet on my tablet I can,NEGATIVE
"Sign in nightmare. Lately it has asked for sign in and no matter how many things I try.. And FINISH..it loops. Given up about 4 times.. Thought I had some patience tonight to deal with it.. But you wore through it... Guess what happens when spotify is stupid... I have 4 other music apps, that's what.",NEGATIVE
Wish I could listen to the songs in my liked songs playlist without having other songs that aren't in the playlist,POSITIVE
"Lots of problems lately with songs duplicating in the queue, not being able to select a song to play from my phone when casting, and songs in queue disappearing among other issues.",NEGATIVE
"bad sound quality, damn i wish i can refund my purchase on premium package",NEGATIVE
constant changes to the ui which do nothing to improve the actual app. it is now so incredibly bloated and slow that it sometimes takes 15+ seconds to load even if it's already running. There are many times where I cannot access my music or podcasts without shutting the app completely and reopening it. They add more ads to the podcasts all the time. Why am I getting ads? I paid for the subscription specifically to avoid ads. If it gets much worse I may have to find an alternative.,NEGATIVE
I give only one star because too much of ad... After every song 1 mins ad... Too much of ad... It's irritating... .,NEGATIVE
"Good but whats up with internet connection? Looks like Spotify finds very hard to recognize when my cellphone its connected or not to a network, I say that cause happened several times, Spotify says im offline then i trie other apps to verify and its all normal. HELLP, more than a year already, it wasn't frequent, now it is again.",NEGATIVE
Makes me listen to 20 songs before playing the song i requested. And the unlucky part - they are songs i don't like + 3 min long. I'll change my review if you fix these.,NEGATIVE
Biggest issue is I cannot reorder playlists manually or make folders in app. Other than that the app is fine. Something I'd love to have in app is though is the ability to set alarms and have them point to a specific song or playlist. There are alarm apps that sync to Spotify but none match the want/need that I have.,POSITIVE
"Nice,lot of songs, awesome",POSITIVE
"The only real problem is the adds, every song has an add it seems.",NEGATIVE
Always on chill.ride while on spotify ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
I have been using Spotify for many years now and even pay every month for one of their plans. Never had a complaint until now. I cant access anything. It keeps saying No WiFi Connection but there is and seems like I am not the only one. The worst part is I contacted the company and not helpful at all. Canceling my subscription and have moved back to I heart radio and Pandora.,NEGATIVE
too many ads and it doesn't let me add more songs into a playlist. this is annoying,NEGATIVE
"Favorite part of Spotify is being able to follow my friends playlist and being able to make a list with your friends where you can both add music you both like. If you ever throw a party you can have people join by link so that they can add music to the que. Only complaints is that it is best with a subscription, and if you follow a playlist it automatically likes that list which messes up my liked music. Also the AI is dumb as hell, all it does is recommend more songs from artist you like.",NEGATIVE
"The app crashes when I'm trying to select a song, so I can't add any songs to a playlist or to the queue",NEGATIVE
Very interesting and outstanding app. I always enjoy even in the washroom. My favourite singer's songs are available at anytimeðŸ˜â¤ï¸ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°ðŸ’š,POSITIVE
"The 30 minute ad free thing is a lie , you watch the video and 2 songs later it plays an ad",NEGATIVE
Spotify does a good job. ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Impossible to find anything in a playlist. Spent months crafting playlists to my liking only to find, out of the blue, most songs give an error message ""this song is not available"". Closing account soon. Should never have gotten Premium.",NEGATIVE
Great and satisfied but sometimes it takes long to load your downloaded tracks,NEGATIVE
"lol, I'm so used to Spotify, i can't even thinking of switching it. This is great and even their chat support is awesome.",POSITIVE
I have a Samsung S22 and and I love all the music you'll have especially the disco and everything is just tremendously 2 minutes late good to hear I enjoy it And it's fun music too so anyone can enjoy it,POSITIVE
Spotify remembers your music genre!,POSITIVE
"Absolutely trash,, cant play songs , nor is navigating the app explained. And regardless of whatever you search they're going to play what music they want you to hear not what you want to hear this app does not deserve one star but that's as low as I can go. Install Trebel instead you will be so much more satisfied!!!!",NEGATIVE
Spotify is my favorite app to use everyday for listening to N.W.A and polo g. The only thing I hate about Spotify is that I had purchase premium.,NEGATIVE
Its a good music app I just wish you could click on any song and play it and not have to wait for it to shovel through and there's an extreme amount of adds,POSITIVE
"I really love this app and highly recommend it . You can listen to any of you favourite song anytime anywhere. But is that you have you get premium to listen to song without ads in between, do unlimited skips, offline listening, play any song of you choice and high audio quality. But still I am in love with this app.",POSITIVE
"Love just about everything about this app. The music selection, Ability to share and discover new music. It's absolutely wonderful!!!",POSITIVE
I love the music opitons on there. There are so many varitys.,POSITIVE
Top notch Features with Clean UI. Just Amazing ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
Would be 5 starts if we get the shuffle downloaded songs button,NEGATIVE
Spotify is great but just like other technology its being used to harm ppl and for revenge on unsuspecting ppl that have no idea what is going on til its to late. I dont know anything about computer or phones but i have common sense and can figure out someone has ill intentions towards me and no ally or individual to confide in.,NEGATIVE
Wonderfull hearing stories like l heard on the radio when I was a child. Something for everyone. Well done!,POSITIVE
Ad free and amazing!! Love being able to share with friends and have playlists downloaded for camping!!,POSITIVE
"It's SOOOOO good, just sit back and listen to music while your playing video games or drawing and many more. I'm obsessed with this app. It is so worth downloading!",POSITIVE
Very good over all but it keeps having an issue where when it's playing something it doesn't show that it's playing and won't allow me to pause it,NEGATIVE
I have Premium and I'm still getting Ads ðŸ˜¡ every couple songs.,NEGATIVE
"This app is frickin awesome. I get my old school music along w/the latest jazz, rock, & country I like. Great ðŸ‘job guys.",POSITIVE
"There's something wierd in this app , i dont want to say somthing just pls bring back the old ver.",NEGATIVE
Why i rate it a 1 IT WONT LET ME CHANGE THE DAM SONG ALL I WANTED TO HEAR WAS GANGSTA PARADISE BUT NO INSTED SOMETHING RANDOM LIKE WHAT EXCUSE ME,NEGATIVE
Idk what has happened to this perfect app really disappointing,NEGATIVE
The best to find music Verry happy.,POSITIVE
Good app I like that commercials don't interrupt you every 9 seconds but maybe get rid of the pop up might make someone accidentally delete one of their playlist or something important. Something weird is that whenever I search up a specific song I press play but it plays a different song and really annoys me. But other than that it's a great app for music!,POSITIVE
Great picks of music! Especially the country ones!ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ’•,POSITIVE
Will not play the songs I want it to play. Will play songs on a similar play list. Having a horrible experience,NEGATIVE
"Its great, made me easy to go around the world.",POSITIVE
This app is so glitchy and doesn't work more than half the time. I'm about to cancel my Spotify premium and switch to sound cloud because what the hell am I even paying for,NEGATIVE
"It's okay, I mean, but for you to have to pay to be able to listen to the song you want is kinda ridiculous. You have to skip multiple songs to be able to get to the one you want.",NEGATIVE
Great app but annoying when it rehularly thinks I'm off-line and I have to lose and reopen to get it to work. Same on multiple phones too.,NEGATIVE
"I don't like the 10.000 songs limit on a playlist, Apple Music is better at this because the playlists can be infinite (or as many as your phone/computer can hold)",NEGATIVE
Way too many ads. Very very limited skips. Basically they do every possible annoying interruptions to get you to try purchase premium.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify!!!,POSITIVE
"no pause button. ever since the update on the 13th, my phone hasnt let me pause/ see what music im actually listening to. im not even able to pause the music without just completely restarting the app.",NEGATIVE
Always works and so nice to make favorites lists. I play my Iris Whistle along with some great tunes.,POSITIVE
Easy to use and a variety of songs for everyone's taste... I'm a fan the appðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
Spotify this app is amazing because my mood is very bad in sometime so I hear the music from Spotify feel good and I have no words for this app because this app is amazing â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
excellent music Auto Jockeyed daily...thank you,POSITIVE
"PLEASE trim the fat on your inefficient app. I have just about a top of the line Android and the lag is nasty. Terrible UX. Slow to cast, which I love to do and constantly do.",NEGATIVE
I pay for premium and have downloaded so many songs yet when my data or WiFi is off I cannot play them!!!! It's extremely frustrating when I was on my flight today and can't play music!!!!!,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is as awesome as wowðŸ¥° I love it it's very easy and user-friendly may good give you guys more strength and wisdom to do more awesome jobs like this one Amen,ðŸ™ðŸ‘ðŸ¤ðŸ’‹ðŸ’žðŸ’˜",POSITIVE
We spend most of our day listening to our favorite songs on Spotify. The recommendations algorithm picks the songs perfectly to the mood and the type of songs it picks is just incredible. Most of the time we get surprised byhow it picks the songs to our taste. Annual plan is a bit expensive but its worth taking it for the quality of music Spotify offers. Finally we fell into deep sleep listening to the soothing songs. Spotify has become part of our daily routine. ðŸŽŠðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ¶ðŸŽŠ,POSITIVE
I love this app. Gets me through my days at work and while doing chores. Highly recommend. Music is life!!!!,POSITIVE
Ads are bit repetitive and you should have a feature allowing you to listen to only the album you're trying to listen to. You should also be able to choose which artist show up on your Bumble app.,NEGATIVE
Get localised advertisement even while paying for premium,NEGATIVE
It fine... theirs 3 ads ariubd every 30 minute or 10 songs but its fine,POSITIVE
Very nice song apps,POSITIVE
Recently had to downgrade this app because it is constantly crashing. Rarely works anymore.,NEGATIVE
Most of the time the music stopped by itself. Terrible experience and I will not going to extend my subscription.,NEGATIVE
The service of Spotify is great but the app is trash will not load or will crash repeatedly it appears that they do not maintain the app on a ongoing basis.,NEGATIVE
"Amazing music platform! However the mobile version isn't the same as the PC version. This one has more ads and you can't skip more than 6 times per hour. You also can't listen to the specific song you searched in order to make sure it's the right one without premium, you can do this on a PC without premium however, these 2 versions need to be put into parody by the developers, then I'd use It on my phone more often.. But overall, amazing.",POSITIVE
You have to pay to enable ads and you cannot pic your own music,NEGATIVE
"The app is good and all but the real problem is the insane amount of ads. Whenever I start to play a song, 2-4 ads show up. Spotify, please fix this.",NEGATIVE
Ends podcast playing at random times. So annoying to try and return to where I was on the podcast because it says I completed it and not even be halfway through.,NEGATIVE
Listen all the time! Very good podcasts!,POSITIVE
Terrific platform to enjoy your choice of music.,POSITIVE
When screen is off Spotify not playing.. please fix this bug,NEGATIVE
Sound quality is horrible. Add suport for better sound formats!,NEGATIVE
Best! Works when I turn my tablet off and no issues.,POSITIVE
Too many ads and play the songs I don't want,NEGATIVE
"Why is there no way to view what songs you have in your queue anymore? The button that would bring up your queue is grayed out. I've added songs to the queue and it plays them, so I know my queue isn't empty.",NEGATIVE
In my opinion it is a foolish time wasting aap. You cannot find your desired song like remixed. 0ðŸŒŸ for it.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is the worst streaming service I have ever used. I don't think it's functioned correctly on android longer than a week in YEARS at this point. There were plenty of issues before this update, but after it I cannot choose any songs in my playlists AT ALL. It registers the click, and does nothing. Premium user, phone is up to date, app is up to date, unisntalled/reinstalled, cleared cache & data, restarted/reset my phone, reset my wifi. The problem is spotify itself, like always.",NEGATIVE
Best music app!!! If I could ever get a trial premium subscription would most likely give 5 stars.,NEGATIVE
"Good source of music, but it would be nice to be able to add an rss feed for podcasts not already in their library. Also, add a setting so I can make it not automatically play my last song when I open the app. I understand some people want that, but I don't. Just give me an option.",NEGATIVE
Just a fancy UI. It is really annoying to use. Horrible UX I must say,NEGATIVE
I like spotify but on mobile is HARD!! Can you please make it easier to use on mobile? Thanks.,NEGATIVE
"This is probably the best music app you can get and I strongly recommend it. The app has very good customer service and the subscriptions are cheap and well made. The music selection is really good too. If I had to rate this app I'd say one out of ten is... Ease of usage 7-8 Customer service 8-8.5 Music/podcast selection 7.5-8.5 Sound quality 8.5-9.5 So over all 8.3 out of 10 but that's still really really good ""compared to the 6-7 Pandora got """,POSITIVE
Awesome app . Music glorious Lots if old songs thst u wouldnt expect they got ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,POSITIVE
This is grate for my health I listen to music every night x thank you ðŸ˜Š ðŸ™ you are the ðŸ‘ i love you ( not in that way as in i love your app) x,POSITIVE
I love Spotify!,POSITIVE
The latest update allows you to only listen to songs via Shuffle Play. you can't choose what song to play anymore unless you're premium user.,NEGATIVE
"I have had Spotify for nearly 5 years. Yesterday all my Playlist are gone and I cannot even make a new Playlist. Because after I name the Playlist I select one song the app closes and it does the same thing on the official website. Also when I clicke notifications it says ""something went wrong try again later"" I am starting to wonder when later is and should I cancel my subscription???",NEGATIVE
Worst experience ever using musical apps this app provides a lot of adds in every single song finally a journey of an 1yr comes to an end in one night bcz of hearing a adds in every single song....,NEGATIVE
"It was good since i only used it to play music on my ps4 now its completely useless to me since ""Only Premium users can do that"" don't download this app at all, everything is now paywalled",NEGATIVE
This app does what I need it to.. And it's FREE. I don't have to pay like UTube Red. Love it â¤ï¸ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
One of the best music app,POSITIVE
Great software and user interface,POSITIVE
Why can't I see what is playing on Spotify? It's annoying.,NEGATIVE
"I like the old generation music and enjoy listening to eightees, ninetees music.",POSITIVE
Everything I need ..... The Ads are annoying tho,NEGATIVE
Free music >>> Spotify ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ full of ads ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“â˜•,NEGATIVE
Great music variety and few ads! Excellent!!!,POSITIVE
I cant take off shuffle because its not a option,NEGATIVE
"I can't take specific song off my queue, one thing Soundcloud wins at",NEGATIVE
"A game changer in music and podcasts consumption, little more to say",NEGATIVE
"So far, outstanding quality and very easy to navigate.",POSITIVE
"I can no longer access my ""Likes Songs"" playlist. Also when I press on the ""heart"" â¤ï¸ button nothing happens, even the heart itself doesn't turn green ðŸ’š. Please help.",NEGATIVE
I have been trying to change my subscription but can't find it. Not showing on my account. I don't know the third party. I can't be charged all the time automatically,NEGATIVE
"Great app, has occasional issues but overall it's fine ðŸ™‚",POSITIVE
I love the radio theater and the music lots of good songs,POSITIVE
Very slow to launch the app. Using on samsung galaxy s10+ with Android 12.,NEGATIVE
"Most of the songs that I try to find, I could find them",NEGATIVE
A fantastic app without many logging in and it access just perfect,POSITIVE
"Very restrictive, You have to pay for almost everything other apps can do for free. It was okay for awhile but after realizing I couldn't do pretty much anything without premium I stopped using it. I would recommend YouTube music way over this.",NEGATIVE
Keeps turning off for the last month straight it just turned off every 5 minutes haven't made a complaint until the other day soon as I do it gets way worse... I've updated twice,NEGATIVE
Great experience I get all the songs I need when I need them.,POSITIVE
Just all round good stuff,POSITIVE
Too much ads,NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"Spotify Ads are MUCH louder than podcasts and it crashes several times a day. Sometimes just the player will crash, but the app stays open and the podcast keeps playing. The only way to pause in this case is to close the app.",NEGATIVE
Why. Why. Why. Why does Spotify keep deleting my saved songs on my SD Card?????,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify But my Spotify is not responding to me Could you please help me,NEGATIVE
Super great app that play with each of your vybes,POSITIVE
Love it. Love the music!,POSITIVE
Love it! Great choices for music experience...and so much more!,POSITIVE
"Tried others music providers ,yet now I see why Spotify is the benchmark that the others try to replicate. Keep it this way, not overpriced so everyone can subscribe again keep it this way",POSITIVE
I've never had anything bad to say about Spotify till now. You no longer get a preview for songs when adding them to a playlist. I didn't think I'd care so much but I do. Now I add songs and just hope I actually like them and if I don't I have to waste my limited skips to skip the song or remove it from the playlist. Absolutely stupid!,POSITIVE
"I just love spotify, man! Tbh.",POSITIVE
I need Spotify to add audio song search,NEGATIVE
So far so good. Lots of music to choose from and even the good old stuff from the goth days back in the 80s,POSITIVE
Spotify is amazing but the ads are so annoying.,NEGATIVE
Love it just ads Sometime are problem And the lyrics are mismatch,NEGATIVE
oml it is an absoloutly amazing app im in love!! my playlist give off the aesthetics that i want and as im a student i find it really useful,POSITIVE
"Omg stop with the Spanish commercials. I don't understand what they're saying so I'm not going to buy the product or service. I'm listening to an English speaking conservative podcast for crying out loud, you need work on your demographic targeting.",NEGATIVE
"My fav app, I use it the most out of my all apps :) It's not perfect - no, I would have few recommendations how to make it better - but out of all music apps - it is the most accurate :)",POSITIVE
"Thank you for fixing the button order, that's the way it should be :)",POSITIVE
Awesome but a little messed up cause when music plays on it the music fades in and out and skips a little alot.,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify and use it every single day for years now. BUT PLEASE, CHANGE THE SHUFFLE BUTTON BACK TO HOW IT USED TO BE.",NEGATIVE
"On June 14th 2022, I went into spotify to listen to my daily music and then apparently I saw you guys did some changes but i had a difficulty with those changes whenever i try to type in a song and press the song it will show me some playlist of some songs and when i go into my playlit it will show me some sings but i cant play it. So please spotify please change back your app into its normal way before the changes you guys make because it will lead you guys into 0 reviews bc of this. Thank you",NEGATIVE
This spotify music app is very good but english song lyrics all correct à®¤à®®à®¿à®´à¯ song all lyrics wrong please change the lyrics...ðŸ˜‡âœŒï¸,NEGATIVE
Nice app.. but the ads are too much,NEGATIVE
Its just the best music app,POSITIVE
The sound quality of all the songs is not good.. if we compare with other apps then sound will come more louder than spotify. I think you have to work on this. But songs collection is superb.,POSITIVE
Music quality and algorithm is top notch. But one big issue is the i can't add a song to my queue by searching . The whole menu list is gone ! Whats wrong with you? This is the so far best music streaming service But this one thing is resisting me now from Taking premium!,NEGATIVE
"Easy to navigate and user friendly. What a delight to utilize this wonderful, straightforward app.",POSITIVE
Crashes all the time after exiting the app.,NEGATIVE
Spotify all the way guys it's so useful. So much better than other music apps. Premium is totally worth it too.,POSITIVE
It used to be ok because you would get ads like every 5 minutes or something like that but now it's awesome because I think they removed ads or I have premium and just don't know it either way I'm not complaining it's an awsome place to listen to music on,POSITIVE
It is nice to not have ads. I just don't see a way to flag something you don't like.,NEGATIVE
It's honestly the best app for music,POSITIVE
You can mostly find any song here..liked it very much,POSITIVE
Thank you for the great music,POSITIVE
"Spotfiy is one of the best music app i ever have and the only problÃ¨me is that on yo click on a song i doesent allways play the song you click on like what the hell i click on on faded (is a song) and a difrent song plays like heat waves (also a song) and you only get 6 skips 6 SKIPS like us broke ppl cant buy spotify ""VIP"" now adays 5 stars only 2 problÃ¨me i have with wait never mind 3 problemes why cant you just loop a song man so you dont have to sherech for the song anyways 5 stars",NEGATIVE
easy and fast access has all the songs I love and,POSITIVE
Using spotify for several years and never going back to pandora or youtube,NEGATIVE
We want to see the streaming numbers of every song on artists' pages.,POSITIVE
Very very good app for podcasts listeners and music lovers,POSITIVE
It's an app that plays you ads. That's it.,NEGATIVE
"Used to be good, last few updates have really stopped me from using the app as much as I used to. Went from using it practically everyday to maybe once or so a week at best.",NEGATIVE
Great aap so good there r so many of songs and playlists for everything,POSITIVE
"I love this app. I can always find the music I want to find and it really helped me find my music taste. But the ads! When I skip through an ad, another ad pops up when I don't need that 30 mins of free ads. It's obnoxious.",NEGATIVE
Why can't this app produce caller tune . Besides it is a great app for music.,POSITIVE
App is good... But there is nothing like 30 minutes uninterrupted listening after an ad. Have to listen to ads between each song. Sometimes youtube seems to be less pushing than spotify to buy premium.,NEGATIVE
"Great app, but a little bit expensive for collage students, well, it's my opinion",POSITIVE
This app crashes every 10 minutes.,NEGATIVE
It's the best music platform,POSITIVE
"Great app, but i cant buy premium with a google play gift card, or i dont know how to because it only asks for credit card or pay pal",NEGATIVE
"Easy to use. It doesn't have every song in the world but it has most American music and top foreign content creators. If anyone wants to use the app for free, then it's honestly not that good of an app. They got rid of the ""ad free music"" pop-up and the ad breaks are longer, around 2 minutes each and I don't use it enough to justify a $120/year subscription. People that are willing to pay, I would still look elsewhere before you sign up because of the price.",NEGATIVE
Best music app out there ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Hey The app is pretty good but there are no lyrics coming on my account please check this issue,NEGATIVE
Best app for listening to music,POSITIVE
"Has many bugs, completely just closes itself when having another app open and I have premium even though that doesn't cause that issue at all, THIS APP NEEDS A FIX",NEGATIVE
Pretty decent app too many ads when I switch from Xbox to phone I'll get a chain of 4 to 5 ads and you can not chose where to start and stop like on xbox,POSITIVE
Newest vwrsion crashes and also restarts the pod im watching when it does. Now i cant get anything to work. Also it changes the list up of what episodes ive watched. Like for rogan it will start me on the list kf like last year. Have to scroll all the way up only to find out im scrolling BACK in timeline. Its weird.,NEGATIVE
The new.update doesn't let u listen to the song u want to listen to. I think they just want u to buy premium and the skips don't even work,NEGATIVE
Spotify makes me happy,POSITIVE
Ads can be reduced,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify! I use it everyday,POSITIVE
Seriously? Are u that greedy for money? Your app is really doing anything annoying and stupid so we can buy your premium this app I the worst I'd rather just listen and stream on YouTube. I don't think people would want an App that's drooling for money and wasting their time.,NEGATIVE
App is good but while using this app on phone we cant change the order of songs in a playlist so i have to use my pc for this work. I too searched net for doing this task but no method worked because the app interfaced changed and methods were old. Rest ad should be less as after 5 songs there is always an ad,NEGATIVE
Absolutely the worst user experience. If you unwilling to pay for premium don't bother installing. Sure you may have to download your music through another player but at least you can choose a song to play and not be surprised when the thing you wanted to play WILL NEVER PLAY,NEGATIVE
"The hell is this? I can only skip songs 6 times in an hour and I can't see individual songs? They're all just in playlists and all in shuffle, my friend said Spotify is good but it's basically unusable for me.",NEGATIVE
Bast audio quality,NEGATIVE
App is ok but recently been having to reset device or reinstall. Playlists are quite narrow,NEGATIVE
Very bad experience Daily same song play in premium,NEGATIVE
"The app is good, i absolutely love it but I recently got a problem in my phone so i updated it, therefore I had to reinstall Spotify and clearly i have been trying to log in sibe last 4 days but it does not let me log in.ðŸ˜… I have tried it in every way be it number or sing in or log in it does not let me in by my, i have my acc already in it i just need to log in. If you could just fix this problem, so i acn use this amazing app again.â˜ºï¸",NEGATIVE
App changed due to the latest update is not possible to listen a preview of a song before add to your list.,NEGATIVE
So far i love it...only a couple weeks and just updated so we'll see after the update,POSITIVE
Why are you removing some songs from your application.,NEGATIVE
Everytime i try to start a Playlist it says something went wrong,NEGATIVE
"With few exceptions, a great site.",POSITIVE
Great music collection,POSITIVE
I think this has a great way of listening to music even without premiumðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
It works really good and just the way the songs dont glitch and stop for a second (unlike youtube) I really recommed this app if you want to listen to music.,POSITIVE
Nice but you need better changes in spotify,NEGATIVE
Best app to play music on all day long,POSITIVE
"What the hell?? You cant control the timestamp of the song, and if you want to play another song in your liked songs you cant play it, it only give you a short moment of the song and IT IS SO ANNOYING, YOU CANT EVEN PLAY AGAIN THE SONG WHEN YOU WANT, YOU CANT DRAG IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OH MY GODD",NEGATIVE
I have downloaded this app just because this is sponsor of Pakistan cricket board. â¤ðŸ’šðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Love from Indian illegal occupied Kashmir.,NEGATIVE
Love the ease of using and the greatest collection âœ¨ï¸ music,POSITIVE
I pay $10 a month for it to force close every time I open it. Started after the last update.,NEGATIVE
My friend sent me a song called Big and Chunky I couldn't hear all of it's without downloading Spotify so I am downloading it right now,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever,POSITIVE
Love this app! Being able to make my playlists and listen uninterrupted by commercials is awesome.,POSITIVE
In this app there is all songs which is currently available and unavailable so plz try it.,NEGATIVE
I really liked this app.It works well after exhausting my daily data limit.This app uses less data and also the sleep timer is very helpful for me fall asleep.Its helps in good listening to music.I really liked this app that is why am giving five stars.I will suggest this app for all music listenors.I can't get lyrics in my phone hope that fix it soon so that i give four stars where lyrics are available in other phones.,POSITIVE
"The app is good but, I think it's too restricting. For example, I played my fav song in my playlist but somehow, it played the other different song in my other playlist. Second thing is that, my cousin purchased the premium and it doesn't even show the download button or neither a pending bar for the download. It also doesn't show if the music is downloaded or not. It's a shame that the app has great performance but it's too restricting.",NEGATIVE
New problems arise every time. I can't remove songs from my Playlists,NEGATIVE
"Extremely slow and unusable now. For over a month now I have not been able to listen to music as I used to. The app is lagging and buffering for no obvious reason, even with a stable internet connection. I used to love spotify but it has become a frustrating source of anger. I've deleted and reinstalled several times now, it's no use.",NEGATIVE
The whole thing which you have to pay for premium and not get advertising is great but for one problem. Everytime you want to listen to a podcast you get advertising please fix this problem The music you get no advertising with premium,NEGATIVE
"Really goodðŸ‘ you can play song when your offline. But, when I played my liked songs, they played other song that I didn't liked.",NEGATIVE
"Garbage. Used to love this app but haven't been able to use for several years, due to fact that it pauses constantly every few seconds or minutes (varies). Have tried EVERY suggestion found to try to resolve with zero luck.",NEGATIVE
Love the offline mode and ability to download playlists. I just realized I could upload music too.,NEGATIVE
Ok let's get straight to it because I'm about to get upset Spotify is the best app I've used in a million years! Ha thought it was a complaint didn't you...gotcha?,POSITIVE
"Nothing works, my playlists, liked songs, and podcasts are gone, I can't listen to any music, and even turning off my internet doesn't let me listen to my downloaded music.",NEGATIVE
"When i click on the song i want to play, it plays a different song :( how to fix?",NEGATIVE
Best place to get your stuff from way better then anything else,NEGATIVE
Spotify is my Best Friend and my Favorite Music nothing really to Change about about it,POSITIVE
Absolutely the worst app I have ever had. Shuts down in the middle of podcasts. Just randomly starts playing a different podcast while I am listening to another one. Just junk.,NEGATIVE
"I absolutely love this station,since get the enjoyment of the kind of music I like. I love gospel and oldies are my go to but there are other types I like and the choices are endless.",NEGATIVE
Great for music love it,POSITIVE
"I cant even go one song without it stopping. The entire point of the app if you dont have premium is to listen to PLAYLISTS. Pretty sure it's not supposed to stop mid song, either. And I dont mean ""pause,"" I mean the notification hot bar literally disappears and the song restarts if it was mid-song. Also, skipping IN ITSELF is now a premium feature? What happened to the 6 skips? Due to this last problem, I've been stuck listening to Fever by Zfeelz OVER AND OVER. Give me my skips.",NEGATIVE
Best music platform!! A +,POSITIVE
I don't like the adds there boring and not really fun to listen to especially when I'm doing word it intrubs me being focused on what I'm doing,NEGATIVE
This is annoying I can't play a song what i want.,NEGATIVE
Over all experience really good it's just and rather often the app just quits and I'll have to reboot to fire it back up fix that you have yourself a hell of a station Thank you,NEGATIVE

"There isn't a song that I can't find here, big or small artists.",NEGATIVE
Excellent app but many adds,POSITIVE
Best music app of all time,POSITIVE
"I love the user-created playlists and the emails you get from your favorite artists for upcoming concerts or merch. Definitely worth the money for Premium - the free version has so many ads, it's unusable.",NEGATIVE
"App has a fault where the play bar vanishes and I have no control to play or stop. Support service have had me on the chat page for 5 hours so far with no progress, this involved me waiting to send a video of the screen without a play button before they would take more action. It still happens and I have so many half finished podcasts I can no longer find",NEGATIVE
"Best app out there for discovering new artists and listening to music across decades. Ive rarely looked up a band and been disappointed to find no files. That being said, I like my music platform like I like my morning coffee, apolitical. If the he said/she said popularity contest of cultural correctness is going to influence the breadth of media thats allowed to be enjoyed we might as well say goodbye to the ""free art"" movement. Bring back Alex Jones. AND PLZ FIX BLUETOOTH.",NEGATIVE
Love finding my favourite tunes to listen to.,POSITIVE
Seriously I loved Spotify a lot!! But lately its just not working.. having network issues with this app only.. doesn't load any songs or playlist.. all other apps work just fine with my network but not this.. please fix this issue,NEGATIVE
"Spotify as a service is great, I have a paid account. I wish on the app you could see what your friends are listening to like when your on a PC. UPDATE: (2022) Not only is the above not fixed. Now when you share a link there is no preview anymore. I've searched the problem and there are tons of people complaining. Why have these great features and take them away, especially to people who pay for it?",POSITIVE
App is really good but sometimes it doesn't play the songs that I like the most..... Cause of that I am really disappointed I want to give 5 Stars but the this really disappoint me that they don't play the song that I hear the most And I like the feature that they give 30 min Ã d free music .,POSITIVE
Thanks for placing the play/ pause button controls back to it's original position!,POSITIVE
"It's a quite good app, but there's a problem with updating. Every time I try to update it, it just won't. Otherwise, it's pretty helpful and functional",NEGATIVE
"Good music app, you can even play music while using other apps, highly recommend app",POSITIVE

First it was playing the right music but then it started playing random musics,NEGATIVE
"Always buggy, but at least I can listen to music sometimes?",POSITIVE
This is the best songs watching app ever,POSITIVE
"Absolute garbage. This app banned Donald Trump, the true president of the United States. It also has nonsensical podcasts about racist, white-hating, leftist, communist trash. Not to mention you can't listen to music on here. This app is only for ads. One song plays, then an advertisement. Another song, then another ad. Delete this trash app and start again",NEGATIVE
new update is screwed up some reason the widget isnt working with the lg g8,NEGATIVE
"it used to be that you could press shuffle unlimited amount of times, but now for some reason it won't reshuffle with a recent update, and i want the old ver back",NEGATIVE
THE NEW UPDATE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. FIRST YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY YOUR SONG BECAUSE IT GOES STRAIGHT TO PLAYLIST AND IT PLAYS OTHER SONGS I DONT EVEN LIKE ND WONT PLAY YOUR SONG AND YOU CAN ONLY USE 6 SKIPS PER HOUR ITS ABSOLUTELY BAD. THERES ALSO ADVERTISEMENTS EVERY SECOND I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO SPOTIFY ANYMORE. LIKE AT THIS POINT I'D RATHER PLAY ON YOUTUBE. I RECOMMEND THE OLD SPOTIFY TBH THIS NEW UPDATE IS JUST SO STRICT AND HORRIBLE!. A WORD TO SPOTIFY. SPOTIFY PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!,NEGATIVE
"Swipe down now playing screen. Why in hell not? This has been requested for ages, the iOS app has had it for years, it's a simple yet so important feature UI wise. I'm switching to YT music...",POSITIVE
"App has been failing a lot lately, music stops randomly - and when I open the app abck up the pause play menu that contains the current playlist and whatnot is completely gone and music is rarely even playable without a hard reset",NEGATIVE
"even with ads, it's still one of the best music apps",POSITIVE
I fell in love with Spotify all my favourite songs are there. Excellent app best ever. The best App for Music.,POSITIVE
"Fine for music, terrible podcast player (I'm a paid subscriber). I can't count the number of times I've had a podcast stop in the middle and either be marked played, or jump to another random episode. This has been going on for quite awhile now and has happened countless times on multiple devices. Too bad this is the only way to listen to Rogan.",NEGATIVE
Audio quality setting if given in the music player itself will be good similar to the lite version.,NEGATIVE
I love this app alot and I will recommend u guys to use this app and listen to your favourite songs. The best thing I like about this app is the playlist with we can make of our own and that's one my heart touching feature I lik about Spotify. Hope you enjoy Spotify music and podcast. Thank you â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,POSITIVE
Great music app. I love it,POSITIVE
It's a great place to listen to music and great for podcast.,POSITIVE
Don't use the paid version. Lots of adds. But good line up of music.,POSITIVE
"You guys have made a really great app.. I really love it and I've gotten premium a couple times. However I feel not being able to play the first song you want in free mode kinda defeats the whole purpose of the app. That's my oy problem with it. Otherwise, really great job.",NEGATIVE
"its a really good app, but its just that when i try to find a song it only is as a playtist and i skip songs from that playtist till i get 3 ads and realizing that the song isnt even in the playtist, and the playtist i created it automatically adds random songs",NEGATIVE
Its really good because when you want toplay a game while listening it lets you i love the app no adds this app deserves 5 stars i mean jts a great app! Thank you makers of Spotify its a awesome idea a d app good job making this app its so good i ca t spell,POSITIVE

Absolutely brilliant ðŸ‘ thanks to Spotify the song you can find are endless rarity the you can't buy from outlets well done I'm always playing my Spotify when I'm working thumbs up ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Since I first started suing Spotify at the turn of 2021, I have actually been flabbergasted at the range and variety of music that is on here; there is literally nothing that I can think of that I lhave not been able to find boatload's of, it really is mind blowing; I have enough to listen to 24/7, and that for me is a big deal. I rate Spotify as worth every pound/dollar, or Euro, and then some. Angelo GB.",NEGATIVE
Good music and podcast app. Just a shame that I pay for membership but still get advertisements. Seems wrong to advertise premium for ad free listening to just throw ads in anyways.,NEGATIVE
"Every thing is very good and I am loving this app. But only problem is that there are adds (It is a good thing, but The main thing is that there are 2-3 adds after 10 songs and they are 30 seconds long) I did not want to say that stop all the ads or buy premium. The good thing will be that if you provide only 1 add 30 seconds long or 3 adds 15 seconds long. Please",NEGATIVE
It's been awhile since I've had a great time listening to music,POSITIVE
This app is just awesome and very satisfying,POSITIVE
I liked it because it has amazing songs,POSITIVE
"About a year ago it was stunning, I had nice music recommendations, various options but now I've got all the same music recommended daily/weekly and I'm just sick of listening all the same. I'm not the person who search for the music and by paying you I thought I'm gonna get some personalised music not all the same tracks I have liked playing repeatedly, and when you recommend something it's usually not even my taste.",NEGATIVE
I cant listen to songs I want to listen to. I click to play a song and sometimes it plays another song. Unless I get premium or whatever I cant listen to the songs I want to listen to. Not even from my playlist. Ignorence at its finest.,NEGATIVE
Fantastic app. So easy to use with great content,POSITIVE
much more fun Reasonable easy and cheaper,POSITIVE
Not able to play downloaded music. Looking for internet connection.,NEGATIVE
"I love this app, the musics are awesome and unique.",POSITIVE
"I refuse to rate this app well until there is as much polish on the Android app as there is on iOS. Please, Spotify devs, just bring the swipe to queue songs and the swipe gestures to close/open the now playing screen. Once this comes to Android I will be happy to rate 5 stars. Edit - quick queue added, improved rating.",NEGATIVE
Best music app I ever had defenetly recommend ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
It's an amazing app so much so that I use it every day it even makes personalized playlists for you based on the types of music you like,POSITIVE
Solid two thumbs up... keep it up people,POSITIVE
Can't live without spotify premium anymore,POSITIVE

"Mostly been good but i reeeeeaaally wish they'd come up with a better widget for spotify that is 1. Prettier 2. Adjustable including size how much info is showing, opacity etc",NEGATIVE
Great as all my old song ðŸ’“ and the up dates are great ðŸ’ž,POSITIVE
"stop begging for permissions! every time I open app I need to deny Bluetooth, while listening trough Bluetooth headphones. also... Free experience is 1*. In other words, listen to constant ads intermixed with couple of songs. Honestly makes me too annoyed to even consider premium, and rather go Amazon or Google music...",NEGATIVE

Love Spotify. Heaps of choices. And discovering new sounds.,POSITIVE
"I'm pissed off.. Don't download this. They are greedy. If you want to play a song or a playlist, they will play you a whole different song and add random songs to it. Please remove this feature spotify and never bring it back. Uninstalling, Zuri â™¡",NEGATIVE
"Would be great if it worked, constantly cuts off for no reason. Songs just fade to a pause after a minute, sometimes less. I've reinstalled the app, took off limiting settings for data etc as I have unlimited data plan. This is so frustrating edit: I found this seems to only happen when I use the daily mail app at the same time. So I can't read the news while I listen. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
Make it so you can edit your Premium account through the App.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify fixâ¹ your bugs and glitches! I love this app, but lately I've to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times. But the songs still shuffle randomly, the song will play for about 18s then stop playing sound while the song is still going on. I go to skip a song and it will go forward and couple songs then go back songs. I cant play what I want.",NEGATIVE
Why can't I play radio songs? Lol I clicked a song and another started to play what is happening to this stupid app. And add a quick playlist add button. Waste of money.,NEGATIVE
I love this app so much! I only give this 4 stars because theres ads,POSITIVE
"Its a fantastic app coz its very easy to locate songs. The reason am giving 3 stars is because internet connection must always be available before u can use it, it would have been wonderful to create an offline mode where u can download songs and listen to them offline like audiomack. Make this adjusment and 5 stars is sure to pop up",POSITIVE
Very nice app ads are very short no disturbance while listening songs,POSITIVE
This app is very very super duper nice!!!,POSITIVE

One of many apps nowadays that actually get worse with time,NEGATIVE
Very pleased with Sportify. Whereby all my family members are able to use it,POSITIVE
I liked it at first but then it started adding songs to my playlist that I didn't want and I thought that was annoying. Second of all it didn't let me lisen to songs i wanted to lisen to and i hated that so yeah i don't like this app,NEGATIVE
I hate the update when ever i want to play the song i want it switches to different song please fix this Spotify!,NEGATIVE
Very very useful app.very short advertisement only.l love very much,NEGATIVE

"Excellent streaming capabilities,wide variety of songs and podcast",POSITIVE
It doesn't work very well at times! I don't like that!,NEGATIVE
"1. The space it consumes can sometimes exceed 12GB in phone memory. I mean what even is going on here? 2. 'No internet connection' bug 3. Some songs can't be played, but still show up normally just like other songs instead of being greyed out like similar non-playable songs.",POSITIVE
Enjoy the music ðŸŽ¶... Keeps me upbeat..ðŸ˜‹ Never have enough of music,POSITIVE
It tastes like cheese with a dash of seasoning of seasoning,NEGATIVE
Love everything this has to offer. U can listen to music with another person at the same time and change each other's music. Has lyrics for 95% songs so u can do keroke. U can hit replay. Make ur own playlists.,POSITIVE
I enjoy the seemless experience of the app.,POSITIVE
Shuffles songs instead of letting me pick one,NEGATIVE
Lyrics are not available in any song.,NEGATIVE
"Tired of all the covid warnings and such, just let us play the great podcasts and music and choose our own beliefs. Great otherwise!",NEGATIVE
"Premium member. Apps awesome until you want to use it offline/download function. I work away, go camping and offshore on my boat frequently. Currently doing 2 weeks away with no music for gym etc. Well done Spotify, you've earnt your 1 star.

You guys thank you so much you lift up my soul each n everytime i use this App,POSITIVE
I am having problems in listening songs as whenever I search for a song it ask me to go online and search even though I am online and every online app is working problem except this one from few weeks,NEGATIVE
This is really frustrating. The app was all good in my tab a few weeks ago but then all of my playlist and downloaded songs won't appear even while using wifi. I can't even play any playlists saying it's all empty??! What's the sense of paying premium if I can't even access my offline library or play any music? You need to fix this ASAP.,NEGATIVE
"Quality poor! The sound quality of the music is poor! I have a bose headsets and the music quality is poor using spotify. YouTube music is a lot better quality! I have high speed broadband, so its not that and i have over 200GB of free space on my phone!.",NEGATIVE
"Instead of listening to music with advertisement in between, it feels like I'm listening to advertisements with a song thrown in between. That's how much advertisement this app has, ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
too many of the same ads with free version,NEGATIVE
That is a good song app and game play with kgf song nice ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Listening to music is my safe place thank you Spotify for being my safe place,POSITIVE

Very user friendly app,POSITIVE
"I've subscribed to Spotify for YEARS. Great app, love my music, etc etc. Recently, however, this app has gained a mind of its own. It will turn off the shuffle and play recommended songs even if I just turned shuffle on. I can be halfway through a song and it just skips to another, completely random song. It used to happen every now and then but it happens every time I'm in the car. It's driving me insane, please fix this.",NEGATIVE
"The app is great, and I love spotify, but it doesn't let me open podcasts when I'm offline even if I've downloaded said potcasts. This is really annoying, especially for long car rides or when my internet is down for a while. Please fix this.",NEGATIVE
"This is not a review it's a complaint!! In BHAJARANGI 2 audio album, NEE SIGOVAREGU and BHAJARE BHAJARE BHAJARANGI songs have been swapped, but name remains the same. I want you to appropriately link the song with its correct name. It's been two months, still no reply of error being corrected!",NEGATIVE

"The wanted music you want to play , you would'nt hear.. The music you would'nt need to hear is playing. So Awful..embarass..disgusting.. Please"" check this out. Phillippines Spotify ,did not serve will. Only there choices to be followed.. Embarassing 4 consecutive ads. Playing you can't",NEGATIVE
Took it down to 4 stars cause you can't turn off shuffle anymore ðŸ˜• EDIT: nevermind they just moved it.You have to go to the three dots in the upper right corner after you go to the current song.,NEGATIVE
Best music app you can use,POSITIVE
"It keeps telling me that I need to connect to the internet to use ... even with my mobile data on and connected to internet. So, I haven't been able to use it. I can't even click on a podcast or anything without the ""connect to the internet"" screen coming up.",NEGATIVE
It's really good it better than Pandora but it's hard with the shuffle stuff beside that it's great,POSITIVE
Great music for all your moods.,POSITIVE
"Really good app you can find almost any song you want on here. One thing I don't like about this app is that it gives you like five ads and then asks if you want to get 30 minutes of ad free music, it should give you like three ads and then like a few songs before it does that that's my one change that I would like. But other than that I love this app I would definitely recommend it ðŸ’…ðŸ¼âœ¨",POSITIVE
"I say to them that I want the app and they make me download it I'm so happy they are so kind, I love them, they are so sweet.",POSITIVE

"This app gives me a semi, free version is great on my PS4. 4 years later, I'm checking my review. This still rings true. I still have spotify, but it's giving me a full on stiffy. I have premium now, I'm never going back. I use it in my car with android auto, it's on all my consoles, Google home devices, on the PC while doing schoolwork. When I go out, I'm using my galaxy buds - I live, eat, breathe, piss and bleed spotify. I will do anything for spotify, it is my BB.",NEGATIVE
Idk what id do without this cuz pandora puts to many ads and soundcloud jus dont hit like spotify does so thanks for being free and easy and having all my songsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜•ðŸ™,NEGATIVE
"Excellent app. Very well made and categorized. However the fact that I got an ad slot of 7 ads at once and the fact that the first ad was one for 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening truly infuriates me. Also, they need to fix their billing system. I had gotten a google play gift card to buy premium but it didn't work.",NEGATIVE
"Now, I like Spotify that it lets us search any music, but it stupidly adds suggested songs in your Playlist and will refuse to let you listen to what you chose. It is annoying as hell, I just want to listen to my music. Giving me a damn headache, is it hard to let us listen to what we want instead of barging into our Playlist? If this gets fixed, I'll leave a better review, for now, I'm not using this.",NEGATIVE
To be honest I thought this until I had it started listening to read on music that are on my list,NEGATIVE
THE APP IS GREAT .. GREAT QUALITY SOUND IS FINE AND EVERYTHING IS WELL BUT WHEN I HEAR KOREAN THEN THE LYRICS CAME IN KOREAN I CAN'T ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OR ANY INTERNATIONAL PLEASE FIX IT OTHERWISE IT IS AWSOME APP LOVE IT BUT SPOTIFY PLEASE FIX THAT ISSUE AND GIVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN KOREAN LINE.......

"too many ads. i literally get like 5 to 8 ads after EVERY song. like idk if that's supposed to motivate me to get premium?? if so, it's really not working. if anything, now im never getting premium out of pure spite.. but also bc im broke.. anyway, the preview feature doesn't wanna work, and that's literally how i would find new music. i also turned autoplay off and it still plays random songs. like i'll literally press play on one of my playlists and it wont play ANY of the songs that i put.",NEGATIVE
Where it's bugged so bad nothing is allowed to play on my Spotify on my phone so their goes my 3000 songs,NEGATIVE
"It's one of the worst apps ever, can't even pick the song you wanna listen to unless you spend money, yea, think about that, just use YouTube or literally any other app that let's you play songs, spare yourself.",NEGATIVE

It's really wonderful app ðŸ˜Š and very useful too â˜ºï¸,POSITIVE
"Used to be great, then someone made a decision to change the look and feel almost weekly. I'm dropping Spotify for this reason and going with TIDAL as my new streaming service, their Hi-Res lossless format is amazing, and the cost is just about the same. Get with the program Spotify or users will continue to drop off daily",NEGATIVE
To hard to get a genre or play list,NEGATIVE
Suggest for Japanese songs to have romanized lyrics,NEGATIVE
"I recommend doing like some software magic on the ""what's new"" section because I click on my favorite artist new song an it ends up taking me to a whole new playlist not even by my favorite artist (didn't even have the song in that playlist btw) and it's like should I even click on this anymore? So I've just been going on youtube to listen to the songs, seen as I can't even listen to them on Spotify. It's just the songs in the ""what's new"" section tho everything else is fine ig.",NEGATIVE
"I can't test the premium version to link to my Epix, because as soon as I choose a subscription it's only Spanish...",NEGATIVE
Excellent variety of music!!,POSITIVE

"It's fun for a while, then suddenly my music playlist gets shuffled and i can't control what i want to listen to. I hate it, very much... It says free but it forces you to buy premium nevertheless. Nice job at ruining a good run.",POSITIVE
I love it it's amazing because now they have lyrics to....,POSITIVE
You guys need to really work on ads!!!!! Please reduce them!! After listening to 2 songs 3 ads start to play which annoys a lot and disturbs the whole ongoing musical mood!!

Great app awesome music selection and quality.,POSITIVE
This Is the Worse Music app ever. Spotify Before Is amazing. Now It does have shuffle and Is worser Than ads,NEGATIVE
Exllent audio quality and very easy to use,POSITIVE
"It was good, but then after only like 2-3 months it said my free trial was over (which i wasnt informed of the fact its a TRIAL). After that it didn't just give me alot of ads, but it made it to the point when i listened to my liked songs playlist, it wouldn't even play them. It would just play some random song that wasn't even liked by me. Wouldve given less stars but I'm being nice.",POSITIVE
"It says that you can loop songs. I looked all over my screen and couldn't find the loop button. And when I turned off visuals for looping, nothing changed!",NEGATIVE
My girlfriend just wants to listen to the same song but can't there should be a feature to where you can listen to the same song over and over again,NEGATIVE
"An amazing app I use for when I'm making deliveries. I use aux and C-port and after a while, the app will just pause on it's own, or loses connection with aux and starts playing through my phone speakers instead. Forcing me to unplug aux and C-port completely and plugging it back in before it plays through vehicles speakers again.",NEGATIVE
I honestly hate this app. Literally charged me 10.00 and I never authorized it.,NEGATIVE
best and simple. love it.,POSITIVE
Spotify app often stops playing in the middle of a song and then comes back on. There are a lot of songs they do not have and there a few songs that the lyrics are not correct. I am not completely satisfied considering I can look on many apps for FREE and not have any of these problems. Two things I'm very happy about is I can play things offline and there are no ad interruptions. The weird stopping in the middle of a song and starting again is aggravating and disappointing,NEGATIVE
The app is very nca and easy to use,POSITIVE
"Okay over all but even though I have premium, Spotify still plays ads. Never gonna buy any of the products and makes me hate the sponsors of the ads even more (Tim Hortons and Justin Bieber s u c k).

"Great music, outstanding service. I use it when traveling and I keep my mind at peace.",POSITIVE
"Since the latest updates I have lost my playlists that u have created and profile is now all wacked out. Also, I cannot even search for songs by artist as I just get a black screen. Once this has been fixed I can give it a 5 star rating!!",NEGATIVE

Absolute trash now. Seven consecutive ads before I can listen to my first song? No thank you.,NEGATIVE
"This was great till it got over run by count less adds and not to mention that there are songs that I used to love listening to that now show that they are hidden and I cant unhide them, it's not that i cant find them, it's that they are just permanently hidden or almost like they're banned",NEGATIVE
"Great music, superb playlists",POSITIVE
"DON'T GET THIS ON PHONE. I had no problems on my table or my laptop, I get to choose my any song whenever I want I can keep it on loop but on phone it's like if it was a different but overall don't get it phone if you are not going to pay.",NEGATIVE

"Please fix the app, it used to be the best music app, now all it does is ""stop working"" and ""offline""",NEGATIVE
Its very difficult to speak with any customer service people,NEGATIVE
"It's pretty good, but a bit buggy at times. Really annoying adverts (including for podcasts on premium plans which makes me wonder what I'm paying for but at least most can be skipped through in 15 second increments). I used to enjoy podcasts like the Wall Street Journal but listening to the same Go Daddy advert over and over again has sapped my interest.",NEGATIVE
I love me some Spotify. I've been using it for about the past 5-6 yrs!,POSITIVE
I love spotify its easy has every genre of music for one low price!!!!!,NEGATIVE
I mean the actual Spotify experience is awesome but the fact that I get 6 months free because Walmart Plus customer and then have to go through all these things and I put different cards on when it keeps trying to charge me for the Free Premium trial for 6 months cuz apparently you can't charge me there's money in my account I Find it highly insulting when I'm not even supposed to be charged to begin with that's what I get for being a Walmart Plus customer,NEGATIVE
Excellent sound-easy-to-use app,POSITIVE

"I NEVER thought I would pay for music...EVER! I tried the 3 months free and in the 3rd month started a job I thought I'd NEVER work, mindless machine operator. 1st night, (10hr shift ðŸ˜’), no music. Longest 10hrs of my life. Didn't know they allowed music till I got there. Never had a job that had allowed it! Still had a few weeks left on my trial so the next night? Not my dream job but the music made it...almost enjoyable! I had to pay the 10 bucks for another month. Selection could be better.",POSITIVE
why can't I make playlists collaborative anymore? This is really annoying,NEGATIVE
"it helps me to easily listen to the songs i recomend but i pick a song to listen to, and it just plays a short form of it ,overall,this is still a good app, good job spotify,i know it is hardwork to make an app.",POSITIVE
"A FEW years ago I used spotify. I found now there is not the Same faultless of programing though, there now is problems with Playing a complete song and finishing that same song. The program doesn't play a whole song.",NEGATIVE

Just a great platform for music,POSITIVE
I'm very dissatisfied with the new popup screen& the split screen & the 60 second preview of songs & the ton of commercials! It's too cluttered & confusing. If a thing works don't try to fix it...leave well enough alone! I love you Spotify inspire of your updating mania!,NEGATIVE
It's cool and works well but without premium you're screwed,POSITIVE
Love it!!! Works everywhere I go!,POSITIVE

Spotify is life and it's the first thing I ever subscribed to ðŸŽ¯,NEGATIVE
Very good and easy to use.,POSITIVE
"You should be able to have collaborative Playlists that only certain people can edit but anyone can see.

When I try to play anything, all songs are grayed-out and I get a message at the bottom saying ""No internet connection available"". All other apps such as the browser have no problem in connecting When I switch to mobile data it does work.",NEGATIVE
Great for down loading songs & don't use any data in car or when you out walking.,NEGATIVE

This is literally an amazing app for music,POSITIVE
"Spotify is great! When ads aren't popping up after every two songs. I will listen to a song, get an ad afterwards, listen to a song, and then get ads after that song even when it says it will give me 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. It's a lie and it ruins the entire experience.",NEGATIVE
"The only reason I don't give Spotify a 5 star review is the fact that Spotify is not the largest music library right now. Besides it's already large music library, but falling short now these days compare to other stream services, Spotify is great",NEGATIVE
"Pretty good to be honest, by far one of the best streaming platforms i've used so far. Especially when it comes to playlists and discovering new artists related to my music taste it goes beyond expectations. Couldn't have given it any other stars than 5ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ”¥",POSITIVE
I gave u only 1 star cos am unable to use my debit card to subscribe to premium from nigeria . this whole thing is frustrating,NEGATIVE
I really like this app I use it everyday my only two problems with it is the security there's no settings option for security there's no two Factor authentication short. 2FA I really hope two-factor authentication will be released very soon my second problem is some songs go out of order and they have no information as to why it's unavailable and when it's going to be available again some of my favourite songs are unavailable in Spotify and I can't think of no reason why it is unavailable.,NEGATIVE

"WE'LL HIDE THIS FROM HOME FOR 90 DAYS, How about never put podcasts on my homepage ever. I don't want my music app to be covered in political podcasts. If my family didn't already have a plan I would rather use the free version of Pandora and if I was going to pay I'd use apple music.",NEGATIVE
It's good on mobile as long as you have premium.,POSITIVE
I like music and this provides a plethora.,POSITIVE
Great for all music genres,POSITIVE

"Please fix the lock screen functions for this app. Getting tired of having to do my full unlock passcode because it isn't working right after the last update for Android. Lock screen is still messed up, dropped this down to 1 star. Normally it's a full 5 stars for me but no man. Need to be able to quickly access from the locked menu.",NEGATIVE
Outstanding audio quality. Loved it Outstanding ADs in every other song. Begging the users to buy membership. Making the users go crazy to buy the membership. loved It I would also appreciate if the Spotify app would decrease the amount of ads to enjoy the free version of the Spotify app. And if the users can enjoy the app..they should be going for the membership. Overall Loved It,POSITIVE
"For a while they removed the feature to preview songs before you add them to a playlist, but they added it back, so I'm giving 4 stars because it's a really good app to use (as long as you have premium), but I don't like how the features that are the reason I pay for Spotify can just be taken a way on a whim for months.",NEGATIVE
For a music app it sure doesn't hesitate to play video ads. Extremely annoying especially since I have limited data.,NEGATIVE
The one thing I dislike are the ads. The only way to remove it is to get a premium. Atleast can you reduce the amount of ads you are showing?,NEGATIVE
"If I could give a zero I would. The mobile version of Spotify is absolute garbage, the app functionality in general feels super stunted, and you can make a playlist and spend 60% of your time listening to bad songs they weave in to your playlist which then uses up your limited skips ðŸ˜‚ Yeah if your only way to get people to pay is to deliberately develop annoyance in to the design of your app I'm good, plenty of way better options ðŸ‘‹",NEGATIVE
I love it i can listen to music everywhere i want ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
I love this app would recommend it to anyone because you could find any song you would like to listen to and it is so easy to use...,POSITIVE

I love Apostle Jennifer LeClaire's Podcasts . They are so helpful and timely. The Prayer Watrriors Podcast ( Episode 001 ) provides insight for intercessors into the times in which we live . This episode offers Prayer points on 'what and how to pray' against a food crises .,POSITIVE
This is my first podcast experience. It's easy to use. The contents are clear.,POSITIVE
I hate when you dont have premium and you can not do more than 6 skips per hour.Like it is your songs you KNOW.,POSITIVE
"Excellent Always reliable, great choice of music",POSITIVE
So i really liked this app so much but idk what happened Spotify started to lag very much and it took so long to play a song or open a playlist all of my playlists and liked songs are in Spotify i really wanna change my song app but I can't only those playlists and liked songs are holding me back please Spotify resolve this issue I'm frustrated..,NEGATIVE
Add to Playlist option doesn't appear when connected via Android Auto. Not sure if its the car or the app...,NEGATIVE
"Read the permissions closely. It a great app, but what you allow or what you agree to share is not worth it. Financial? Share all personal information? Allowing to have all your history? Way way to much personal info to give/share with the unknown people behind the other end.",NEGATIVE
Since I've upgraded to the paid subscription I'm REALLY enjoying Spotify. I used to only listen to YouTube bit they have way too many ads and commercials. I'm loving Spotify!,POSITIVE

"It's very difficult to even reach to a song using artist name, i.e., this practically don't serve its main purpose. When we see metadata of a song, it's not possible to click and open artist profile page (of singer as well as lyricist). This makes it very inconvenient to use. It would be great if these problems are solved.",NEGATIVE
Great and easy to use,POSITIVE
overall good but please bring back the little thunder at the top right where you could see the latest albums of the artists that you follow. it's so handy.,POSITIVE
Overall experience of app is very good but the most irritating level of ads compared to other apps providing same service. Switching to other app just because of too many ads. I hope you guys read the reviews.,NEGATIVE
A good quality app. Only downside is the fact that I cannot check my most played songs or artists.,NEGATIVE

Unlimited music. Awesome. Enjoy.,POSITIVE
It was good when it worked. Shame it won't work anymore.,POSITIVE
"Glitchy. Always says no internet. Takes ages to load. When it works however, its great.",POSITIVE
Very fast and accessable,POSITIVE
After New Update I Can't Play Songs In My Playlist. It Will Play Random Song That Didn't Have On My Playlist. Please Fix It ASAP,NEGATIVE
Your app is constantly stopping!!! I love spotify but it's enough to make me stop using it!!,NEGATIVE
"Accidentally tapped on the ""hide Song"" feature in this unintuitive mess of an app, had to navigate through the menu to even see the song to unhide it and it still doesn't play. And Apparently the few minutes on Android take seniority over years of desktop use because I literally can't reverse it on my PC without it saying I have to do that via the Android app.",NEGATIVE
"I can believe I thought apple music was it ,this is 10000000000 times better",NEGATIVE
Well it's all good but there is only one problem that it so so many adds but besides that 1. It's very easy to use 2. The audio quality is very good ðŸ™‚ 3. It has dark mode baby aha...,POSITIVE
Bruh every time when I select a song for my alarm it always plays ANOTHER SONG like I selected I won't run and it played we'll meet again bro spotify fix you're god damn app and make it better oh wait you can't you guys are horrible with you're job,NEGATIVE
Good but to much ads,POSITIVE
I am loving it. Wish more songs had more lyrics but otherwise amazing.,POSITIVE
Spotify spends 100 million for covid misinformation and racism on their platform but doesn't pay musicians anywhere near adequately. Still waiting on HiFi! Push and pull for me to move to Tidal! Huge unusable lag before playing any song tapped on in liked or when trying to play over Spotify Connect. Can't maintain a private session. No easy option to switch an existing account from Facebook sign in to Spotify sign in. Lyrics feature didn't appear until support manually fixed it for my account.,NEGATIVE
Great service. App has started to crash a lot. Please fix (galaxy s22),NEGATIVE
When u open data connection then your mobile balance will disappear,NEGATIVE
"The app is awful, and it keeps getting worse honestly. I even find my friends using iOS complaining about it. Spotify, please put more effort into your app. Until then, I'm switching to anghami.",NEGATIVE
"Nice app, easy to use. Zero issues in my day-to-day use",POSITIVE
why did u have to make changes to Spotify it was better before now it doesn't even play my playlist anymore,NEGATIVE
It was hard to just cancel on the app. After I used free 3 months.,NEGATIVE
This is good for finding playlists and so much more ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†,POSITIVE
"Love it, literally better than every music app in my opinion. The only thing is it's horrible to use without premium so like if you have premium it's awesome otherwise just bad with a lot of ads.",NEGATIVE
"It's great app since when I installed it i never clicked out of it, can definately add the feature of slowing down the songs but.",POSITIVE
Good app with little interruptions,POSITIVE
It is a good app .But i cant see the lyrics coming.that is my only complain..,POSITIVE
Just the thing is i m not able to see lyrics for songs after updating app several times....,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a music app that is fairly popular and has a very wide selection of songs, podcasts, and others without very many bugs",POSITIVE
Easy to use. Everything is easily obtainable,POSITIVE
I use Spotify everyday. Premium is really good and helps to have the Hulu bundle. I never have any issues and I haven't used another streaming app in years now. Nothing compares for me.,POSITIVE
"Not good at hall, hardly very few things are available as per the content, inspite taking the membership also we don't get proper service from the new version of this app",NEGATIVE
But we want the music we have downloaded go into our internal storage,NEGATIVE
"The songs I add to my liked playlist don't add anymore, I can't scroll or pick between genres anymore, and podcasts dont play. FIX IT SPOTIFY",NEGATIVE
A very good app... Can be compared to youtube..,POSITIVE
It's been years since I had a version of this app that didn't glitch out regularly. I've had a lot of problems with it stalling out and freezing. I have to do a lot of force stopping on this thing. It would be awesome if premium customers were able to skip podcast ads too. This isn't exactly the cheapest subscription service I have either.,NEGATIVE
"Overall it's a great service, I tend to use it on my phone at work or the Playstation at home. I use premium so no ads, my biggest issue is the songs keep getting removed when I go back to listen to them. Granted I'm looking for songs that they had a few years ago but it's disappointing I'm unable to find or play them.",NEGATIVE
"First rate music of all kinds you can think of classical, modern, pop, punk, glamrock, etc.....",POSITIVE
"The app's fine, but when I connect to Bluetooth it automatically starts to play music and there's no way to turn that feature off.. it's really annoying and tedious because even though I never opened the app I can't even close it without clicking on the app and then closing it from there..",NEGATIVE
"its got more music than you can posably listan ,all in digital format",POSITIVE
"Great App, links across devices and plays the things I love. Ideally you should subscribe to Spotify for optimum usage",POSITIVE
"Really good for me,am very happy now .all types of songs here.ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
You can get rid of those stupid Covid propaganda messages any day now. I might give you 3 stars you virtue signaling idiots. Stop if people wanted that they could watch TV. Joe Rogan is your biggest draw stop shooting yourself in the foot. You are better than that.,NEGATIVE
"The ads are insane at this point, 1 MAYBE 2 songs play and then 4 minutes of ads. The ""watch this video for 30min of ad free listening"" is a lie every single time now. Watch it, one song plays and guess what, 4 minutes of ads again. Don't deal with the bs, go back to Pandora where they won't bully you into buying premium. Also their 4.3-star rating is a complete lie, vast majority of the ""5 star"" reviews are spam accounts, if you read them you will see actual people are giving 1-2 stars.",NEGATIVE
DAMN EWWW THE LAST UPDATE (2022 JUNE) ITS SO BAD ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž WHY I CANT CHOOSE SONGS ACCORDING TO ME??? HMM....??? @Spotify WE WANT OLD SPOTIFY BACK SEE ALL LATEST UPDATE REVIEW ARE 1 OR 2 STAR IT SHOWS SONG FROM DIFFERENT PLAYLIST WHEN I TAP SHUFFLE PLAY ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  WE WANT OLD SPOTIFY,NEGATIVE
"Cannot cancel premium user via the app, which is a big hassle. Should add the option to opt out of the subscription via app. You just milking out people.",NEGATIVE
Good enough. Sadly this is the best audio streaming service for capabilities of the platform and song library. Having Podcasts mercilessly marketed as the default is awful and the audio quality isn't good.,NEGATIVE
I enjoy hereing picking songs i like,POSITIVE
the app works fine at all but it literally annoys me so much how you can only skip 6 times an hour. that's literally just absurd. literally after you removed the good features like skipping whenever and how much you want the app literally went down hill. you need premium to do half of the things on the app. yall really need to get it thru your heads that not everyone can afford premium.ðŸ’€ L fr,NEGATIVE
Superb music app. The best around ... by a mile!,POSITIVE
My app isn't working well with my 5g phone.. can yall fix the glitch? I have to keep Uninstalling and reinstalling. I've paid for the family plan for years and now it seems like a waste of money,NEGATIVE
"It's not working, unresponsive",NEGATIVE
"Fantastic music streaming service. I use a family plan premium membership and we've had no difficulties setting up each individual account. There is a tremendous amount of music available and I love that you can add your own downloads. One thing I would love to see is something similar to YouTube Music in that when you click on a specific album, a short synopsis from that album's Wikipedia page shows up and gives you some background information on that specific record. Add that and it's a wrap!",POSITIVE
"I like all of the music and podcasts, but the app SUCKS!!!!!!",NEGATIVE
Great music app. The best.,POSITIVE
why can't I play songs before I add them to my playlist? add this feat back plss Edit: it's back :D,NEGATIVE
"3 stars cuz it doesn't have ""unshuffle"" button! ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ",POSITIVE

YOU JUST TOOK MY 149 PHP WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME i want refund spotify pls reply to this i could spend all that money to buy me some food :( also premium sucks why wont it let me change plans? or cancel them? pls fix this,NEGATIVE
Only option I have on phone for most things is shuffling but don't have that problem on other devices,POSITIVE
thank you for paying my favorites people ARTISTS!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"It was very good,but premium is very expensive and I love to listen to the music . I wish premium was cheaper and the free version could do offline streaming .",POSITIVE
"It was best. But the indian spotify sucks. Not every song is available, and the most popular songs are also not available. What do we do with this application when there are no songs which we want to listen to and love listening them",NEGATIVE
"I have been using Spotify for months now , and trust me it is a really good app for music. But what stopped me from giving it a five star is that , sometimes , while i am listening to songs and go on another tab , let's say Google , to search something , the app automatically gets closed and i have been having this issue from a long time now. I hope the team can help me if there is any setting to do something with it. But overall , it is a good app for music and i would totally recommend it.",POSITIVE
When I select an album it plays 2 maybe 3 songs from the album then switches to radio based on album. If I put an album on its because I want to listen to THAT album not random stuff that sounds kinda similar,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever!!!,POSITIVE
With the recent updates the song icon is not showing in Spotify. Kindly fix this.,NEGATIVE
"The overall app is good....but one function that they can add and will really help... Will be that.. adding songs to queue just by searching them. By searching it , it just starts playing and ruins the whole queue we set .. So please add this feature too.ðŸ™ðŸ»",NEGATIVE
Just want to say I loved the app at first but now it locked me out of all my downloads my library a my liked songs my artist that I download and it's not playing any music now I just want to know what's going on?,NEGATIVE
Spotify is good and the platform doesn't suck but there's too many ads. There weren't so many ads that use this all the time right now I only use it when I'm gaming. If there wasn't an ad every time I skip four songs I used it all the time. It's a good platform and I recommend using it,POSITIVE
Super buggy these days,NEGATIVE
Spotify is a good music app with fresh n new music,POSITIVE
Sometimes when I have a phone call in car it stop my music working and have to restart my Google pixel 6 phone,NEGATIVE
Basically I have no choice to listen to music. ðŸ˜‚ Thanks,NEGATIVE
When i Started using Spotify It Worked Great. But Lately It Keeps On AutoPlaying Other Song. Its So Annoying and It Makes My Spotify App To Glitch Making It Impossible To Play The Song That I Wanted To. Its Like Spotify Is Forcing Me To Pay For The Music That I Wanted To Play. Because You Need To Pay Subscription To Disable AutoPlay.,NEGATIVE
Best music app I ever see,POSITIVE
Its a good app because if you are sad mood this app changed your mood in happiness and it is so amazing app and I am so happy because I have this app,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify, hear what I want to hear!",POSITIVE
The best streaming music.,POSITIVE
Even a dummy can do this with a little bit of sense,NEGATIVE
"Spotify used to be a good app, now it's just full of ads, uninstalled it,very annoying.",NEGATIVE
I pay for premium why do I have to listen to ads constantly?,NEGATIVE
Best app ever to post your podcast and find new content.,POSITIVE
Ads suck bit other than that it's pretty cool,POSITIVE
Never could update card details so can't play music in my van no Internet is Al l I get but that is Spotify s fault hence poor review,NEGATIVE
"Hello, why spotify alwasy automatic playing while i am open the apps? I was find setting to turn off ,but there is not an option for that. I am using samsung galaxy S21 and also S22 in the same case. Please fix it or just garbage for a while if not fix!",NEGATIVE
if you can't/don't want to pay for premium then don't download spotify. there are so many ads and you can't play specific songs (very stupid and stank) even YouTube is a better option and it's not even made for music. if u have a laptop/computer then use spotify there cus it's way better.,NEGATIVE
Good app but we can't listen it without internet,POSITIVE
"Everything was fine until I decided to opt for the premium version. I'm a student and chose the student account, but i don't know why but Spotify just can't take my payment. Whatever I try with, debit or credit card. They can't process any of them. I've tried multiple cards of various types but it failed. I won't recommend any student for a premium student account.",NEGATIVE
Worst app experience ever. So glitchy. Blend invites don't work. Find friends shuts app off. Horrible app.,NEGATIVE
I can't even play the music I want because it's playing something else I don't like!!! Fix it now!!,NEGATIVE
It's been down for 2 days and when it's up it takes FOREVER to load. And I pay for the service,NEGATIVE
This app used to be good but now there's to many bugs and problems. I'm extremely close to canceling my premium membership and going to a different platform. Whoever is running this app is doing a terrible job.,NEGATIVE
App is vary good but many updates,POSITIVE
Consume more mobile data even in data saver mode,NEGATIVE
"This app was fine,until the new update came,when I choose a song,it plays another song that I did not pick,also the timestamp became useless,I do not recommend using Spotify,YouTube/YT music is way more better,please fix this! Or else I will move to YouTube music",NEGATIVE

Excellent quality and great choice,POSITIVE
It's now annoying it keeps on saying no Internet connection even though I am connected to Wifi.,NEGATIVE
"I very much prefer the PC version of spotify as it allows you to play a song you choose. This version on the other hand, only shows the preview and you cant even choose the song you want inside that playlist.",NEGATIVE
Fantastic music any time,POSITIVE
"Still Great! The new changes, and improvements you have made are stellar. Thank you for continuing to work so hard, to make all the music available, available to all the people. Jam On!!",POSITIVE
"The app was great until yesterday. All the playlists have been empty since yesterday. Even the ones created by Spotify, not just the ones I created. It won't play songs even if I search for them but everything works just fine on my laptop.",POSITIVE
"Plays you 2 mins of ads, then a totally unrelated song. Meanwhile other services will at least play the song you've chosen after advertisements.",NEGATIVE
"This app is worse than bad. Worst performing app on my phone. Screws up on am s22 ultra. Nonsense. They know it and won't or can't fix it with inept developers. Don't waste your money on premium. Just listen to Rogan from the free one and fast forward the commercials. Spotify, you should be ashamed.",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming service,POSITIVE
The experience is good but there's still room for a lot of improvement,NEGATIVE
Best app for listening music. Download this app. It's free to use and this is good. Download this app and enjoy. 5 star because it's great.,POSITIVE
"Was premium for 8 years at least. Moved to free and the service is complete dogsh1t. Ads every song, few skips an hour. Can't choose the song you want to play. Better ways to incorporate a free service.",NEGATIVE
"please remove the free plan as it is very mediocre, things jumps to your playlist, you skip 6 times an hour, that is just useless.",NEGATIVE
Want a break from the ads? Uprade now to Spotify premium and enjoy ad free music.,NEGATIVE
When ever I search for a song and the thumbnail comes up as the song it takes me to a complete different song as a example if I search up rapgod a Chinese song will come up,NEGATIVE

"App crashing and not opening after update!! S22 Ultra Snapdragon again :""(",NEGATIVE
This is my favourite app for songs All songs are here But only one dought Spodify premium wasn`t free Only one time plzz free the premium member ship,NEGATIVE
Why is it that certain songs aint on here but on apple music smh,NEGATIVE
"while im in bluetooth earphone the music has auto low and thw quality of the music is not that great,btw im a premium subscriber and this is the last month that I will pay for this kind of music, not worth it",NEGATIVE
Poor performance..... automatically songs where stops....,NEGATIVE
Great app. Easy to use!!!,POSITIVE

"Good Quality and whatever but seriously, you want me to go premium to turn off Shuffle?! Madness, I'll uninstall and use another app.",NEGATIVE
"The app overall is a good app but for those who don't get the premium subscription, at first there a re very little ads but as time goes by the number of ads start to increase. Something like 5 ads before a 2 min music. But the ux(user experience) is very good",POSITIVE
Amazing app for music ðŸ˜‡,POSITIVE
Love Spotify. Always entertaining and always works.,POSITIVE
Good over all. Nice selection to choose from,POSITIVE
Very good app. Sometimes I have to mess around and reset my phone or stop the app a few times because it can't play songs or whole playlists,NEGATIVE
Not working with chrome cast may ots a glitch,NEGATIVE
I don't like the insistence that we need to rate them!! The idea of rating an app should be at the end of the year of being with said app. because you've had a chance to experience it enjoy it or hate it and then you can give a fair assessment on the app itself. I gave it four stars which in my opinion is above the average only because I've had a very limited experience with the app. Thank you Spotify for insisting on a rating. Update: my feelings on this haven't changed.,NEGATIVE
"more options for random playing, like no same artist in a row sequence, or one artist one song only in a session..ðŸ™",NEGATIVE
Does what it's supposed to. Easy to navigate ... Easy to use.,POSITIVE
Gave me 6 30 second adds and add a replay and reverse like what the hell,POSITIVE
Superp app and enjoying every moment of it.,POSITIVE
Good but so much ads,POSITIVE
My most loved app. I wish I could get premium ðŸ˜•,NEGATIVE
Nice ðŸ‘ app; but you can't download the online music,NEGATIVE
Easy access to proportion whatever and however you want to put your music together.. Great App.. Only downfall is Spotify not having every song that your looking for if you are a MUSIC HEAD like me,NEGATIVE
Super cool app i really love the multiple genre collection of music but i give it four because it would be even more awesome if you could download the music...since Spotify needs internet access. But other than that...this app rocks!!! Keep it up guys!!,POSITIVE
Very good spotify i love it,POSITIVE
Its reallly good for music <3,POSITIVE
"I love it, sample and easy to use but sometime you should pay to get a nice service.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is addictive.,POSITIVE
"Like , I would listen to songs on really I mean really low network connection , but the songs play smooth as butter",POSITIVE
Horribly optimized for android and there is always a large bug every other update that will plague the Android version of app for weeks until random update,NEGATIVE
"my experience of 3 years has been really good, some things which i think can be improved are translated lyrics, music videos for songs which have them,, wish downloading was available for free too lol",NEGATIVE
App keeps crashing and deleting all my offline music. This is absolutely annoying and shows how much effort they put into android version of their app.,NEGATIVE
"Amazing, has many playlists of your choice to choose from",POSITIVE
I like this app because of bts songs is there...,POSITIVE
A very solid user interface.,POSITIVE
Have to uninstall EVERY TIME I want to play MP3s stored on my device. When Spotify is on my phone it forces me to use it to open my personal MP3s but it fails to open them and crashes - so forced to uninstall Spotify every time I want to listen to them. Cancelled my subscription as a result.,NEGATIVE
I have found all BTS songs that's why I rated it with 5 starsâ™¥ï¸ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
Could pay more to the artists. They somehow ruined the remote group session feature.,NEGATIVE
It is an amazing app i love enjoying my favorite songs and listening to playlists while doing my chores(and whwnever i am bored)thank youâ¤â¤,POSITIVE
hope also for poor with minus datavoliums a enter for free music thanks maybe the time come when pure come rich than me pay a 1 euro ok so than now only thank you for get a bit free music less datavolium away free child che 11544,NEGATIVE

I have never seen a app like Spotify to listen to song.best appðŸ‘â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Very good.its only that i cant play songs offline,POSITIVE
Some things went wrong error message,NEGATIVE
"This app is ruined now. I pay a subscription for the app to randomly crash, songs to play with no sound and have to be restarted. I listen most days and I can't remember the last time I played a play list and didn't have to unlock my phone to restart the app or go back on to figure out why the music stopped.",NEGATIVE
I really enjoy it. Making your own playlist listening to songs you love with new recommends. It amazing!!! Literally amazing!!! :) I would suggest a sleep mode where the music turns off after the prescribed time. I listen to music while sleeping and it would be epic to have it on spotify,POSITIVE
"I understand that mobile apps are design to be handle by touch, but I think that your web player or your tablet versions could have drag and drop, making it easy to reorder playlists and songs in a playlist, instead of going through a menu. Obviously Windows version is more user friendly in this sense. Spotify could be such a great app if the developers understood how their clients use it. Please add drag and drop to mobile apps, or at least to the web player. I'm and android user, by the way!",NEGATIVE
Amazing app honestly but only on computer. On my Mobile device it never plays the actual song when I search it up and it always shuffles lots of complaints but no fixes? Why is that Spotify?,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever! You'll find all the music you want here! ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
I enjoy the music..but how to download the music,POSITIVE
Please add telegram to the sharing shortcuts,NEGATIVE
I hate how there is always ads ðŸ˜’ but other wise Allgood,POSITIVE
Would more options of continues play instead of just one episode,NEGATIVE
"It's been a while now since Spotify overhauled their app. However, I thought I'd leave a review as the functionality is terrible! Not to mention the clunky home page and recommended songs that aren't relevant whatsoever. Bring back the old Spotify!!",NEGATIVE
"Really enjoying this app, definitely going to carry on after my free trial month. Worth every penny. ðŸ˜",POSITIVE
I think the app is going downhill now there are many glitches the app will close automatically songs will stop being playing After 2 or 3 minutes and there are way many adds,NEGATIVE
I love when I can turn my tablet off and the music is still playing. And I give it a five out of five,POSITIVE
"The best music listener app. This is desined to listen a high quality music using low source of data. This is a best coded app and it never glitches of stop working while listening. It also recommends you your top mixes new fresh songs and new for you, daily mix and many more. I'll give this app 5 star rating but there is a problem they recommends you to buy their subscription everytime about in every 10 to 15 minutes and they add 2 to 3 ads in short period of time, btw best app. Download&Enjoy",POSITIVE
great app but need a stand-alone app for wear OS,NEGATIVE
"Usually brilliant but a recent update has caused issues. My downloaded music keeps deleting and, more importantly, whenever the app is playing music in the background it's causing stability issues in my (Samsung A53 5G) phone and causing it to restart, constantly, it's very irritating. I spent ages thinking it was my phone, or other apps, but through a process of elimination (deleting and disabling apps, putting my phone in safe mode etc etc) I've tracked the problem to Spotify. Please fix",NEGATIVE
Very nice app for listening songs ðŸ‘ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
Great for Spotify,POSITIVE
Easy and good quality,POSITIVE

Such a great app for wonderful music,POSITIVE
"Horrible customer service. Poor ethics and incompetent employees. After 4 years of asking Spotify to cancel my account, they are still charging my card and ignoring my requests. Amazon music and and pandora is just so much better.",NEGATIVE
I'm so disappointed with Spotify at the moment... I bought a new phone and downloaded Spotify in it my old account was not getting logged so I thought of making a account with new mail.. it didn't work now I'm trying the same process from last week but Spotify isn't getting me logged in or letting me sign up I used to love Spotify so much but now I hate it for the equal... I tried to make account on my another phone and it worked idk why Spotify isn't working on my phone pls help me resolve!!!,NEGATIVE
"The best music app , period !",POSITIVE
I don't why it's keep getting closed automatically with out any error,NEGATIVE
Man the unhide option is not working. I am really frustrated,NEGATIVE
"I really loved the app, but the update is terrible. It won't let me unshuffle playlists and you need premium just for that! It's beyond ridiculous. Please, change this. It just feels like it's pushing us to buy premium. It's extremely annoying. Also, the shuffle feature plays random songs that aren't from my playlist. This app is so confusing now, I just want to listen to my favourite songs.",NEGATIVE
"Great app but its not accepting my card for payment anymore, My card is working fine with other apps tho ......",POSITIVE
everything is good but my question is i have so many downloaded songs then when i open the data it's downloading again i mean it's downloaded right? so why it's downloading again? sorry I'm bad in English but i hope you understand guysðŸ’—,NEGATIVE
Clear music you can find the music you like on here I recommend,POSITIVE

"The app continues to stop in the middle of a podcast or song indiscriminately. Once they fix that, I will give them back the other 2 stars",NEGATIVE
"Having issues with the media player disappearing every now and again, usually after connecting to a device via Bluetooth. Once disconnected it carries on playback through the phone speaker, but with no media player showing it can't be paused or stopped. Apart from that, happy with the service.",NEGATIVE
No ads and great selection,POSITIVE
Very amazing App. A wide variety of music and has no problems using it.,POSITIVE
Overall a very nice app better than resso. It has all songs available which i want to listen. There are not ads it is just minimum. Very nice app. Only the place where you have to improve is auto recommendation and music according to taste of user. You have to improve on that. At last please add one more feature 'listen together' So that two people listen same song at same time but at different places . Plz add this feature,POSITIVE
"I dont like the latest update the songs that I want to play is now shuffle with different kind of music (though I dont even like the music that playing randomly) also, I can't rewind the song and the other button has been missing like the 'add to que' and other :( I now can't play my fav music cause of shuffle",NEGATIVE
"I hate it on how it suddenly changed, it was just like I can play everything now I can't the only thing I could do is shuffle musics that I liked ðŸ™",NEGATIVE
I've been enjoying this app so much. It makes listening to music easy!!!,POSITIVE
"I can't listen to the music I like on my playlist, so if you can fix this bug and other bugs that would awesome. Thank you.",POSITIVE
"Its terrible, i suggest you use youtube music, at first i thought it was great but once you have it for a while it gets annoying. Also the last few updates have been horrible. I think that not being able to chose what song you want to listen to is very annoying, you end up having to skip most of the songs. It also adds things to your playlists. I have a wide variety of music and most of the songs they add i personal hate. I love YouTube music so much more and none of these problems are there.",NEGATIVE
I love blackpink and BTS and the song but when I play in Spotify platfrom I get it more experience ðŸ¤—â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Trash! This music app is so hard to use! Songs that i want to play doesn't show up instead other annoying songs show up!,NEGATIVE
"Love it !!! Sets up all my stations the way I want, anticipates my listening desires, just all around Joe Crowley friendly... ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜Ž",POSITIVE
They have some songs that are pretty hard to find and they come up with the best playlist,POSITIVE
Nice songs collection but problem is after downloading the songs without internet it's not playing for that we need internet too.,NEGATIVE
"Need premium membership just to skip tracks This is getting stupid taking away the most of basic features well let me tell you that you have just lost a long time user Edit: spotify have just replyed saying get the free trial for prem or buy our other packeges, unaceptable",NEGATIVE
"Started using spotify on mobile and shocked by my experience. I have had multiple errors that support have tried ""fixing"" but none of it worked I have had random songs being added to my playlist that don't show up In the playlist with autoplay off. I have also got told to get Spotify Premium because the app won't let me skip even though I haven't even used any of my skips. Another problem Is the amount of ads. I had 5 adverts which really pissed me off. No wonder why I use an ad blockers on PC.",NEGATIVE
Best music app. with terrible adds.,NEGATIVE
I love it the app but the only thing bad is like 12 ads just to hear a song,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify but one thing I don't like it's the fact that it's hard to just play straight songs not to skip all of time I don't like that so fix that and I'll give you 5 stars,POSITIVE
Awesooome!!! Always my FAVE... all then other apps be playing for second bro.. yall are doing an amazing job bless up good job ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"This Is a great app, great to listen for free, and if you pay for spotify, then you get to listen to spotify offline, alright prices, I listen to spotify 24/7 Haha, I rate this app with 4 stars, if spotify want me to give them 5 stars, then this app would be amazing for the Nintendo switch, for gamers, spotify Is on the xbox one, so it makes sense to bring it to the switch... other rise this Is a great app, I had great experience with spotify thanks.",POSITIVE
"Alot better format, easier streaming, and more choices thanx Spotify you Rock!",NEGATIVE
Very good because bts song is avalable,POSITIVE
Easy to use and wide range of albums so you don't have create your own play list.,POSITIVE
I must confess this is the best music streaming so far,POSITIVE
"Absolutely perfect, always works and it's always performed for me.... Even when needing updated, and never noticed anything negative after an update.",POSITIVE
This app is so good i can listen every music i like i just love it,POSITIVE
"When it works its awesome. But sometimes it will just randomly stop playing a podcast. Also it will occasionally just refuse to play podcasts all together. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it didnt help. I signed out and back in, and it didnt help. The only fix i found was pressing play on a podcast and even though it isnt playing, to just let it continue to try i guess. Then after a few minutes the podcast would start to play. Ive used this method twice now. It worked both times.",NEGATIVE
Recently this app isn't working on Airtel network,NEGATIVE
"Spotify used to be my number one music app, but they just refuse to launch hi-fi audio and Dolby Atmos (or 360Â° audio in general) support. So they lost me as a paying customer since other apps provide superior audio quality and features for the same price.",NEGATIVE
It's a good app but the Last updates are horrible 1.you only get a number of skips per hour I don't necessarily have a problem but other people might 2. When you make a playlist Spotify adds other songs that you didn't add and that's kinda where I have a problem with the skips 3. When click to see the playlist you have click something else to get the song don't mind that just when you Tap on the song it only plays a little bit. Spotify if you do fixs these I will give a five star,NEGATIVE
"What is missing HIFI music and a customised sleep timer, otherwise its the best music app to cater for music",NEGATIVE
"Good app, but less ads would be good",NEGATIVE
"Needs few things to get 5th star. 1. Lyrics for songs, 2. List of all songs from an artist, 3. Option to sort songs by popularity (on a list of songs from an artist). Other than those few little things, app works great if you pay for premium Edit: the lyrics got added, just a bit more!",NEGATIVE
Free version is annoying. Ads and more ads. The most ridiculous ads possible. Premium version is ok.,NEGATIVE
Great music selection,POSITIVE
I can enjoy listening to music anytime where ever I go easy to find anytype of music you would like to listen to enjoy,POSITIVE
this app is so buggy and the payment isnt even worth it,NEGATIVE
"Spotify gets me up and going. Love my music, memories, experiences!",POSITIVE
I can't listen to the song I want without skipping or paying to listen to it,POSITIVE
Hands down best music app,POSITIVE
I love Spotify but for some reason it seemed like they always trying to take a payment from me. Like I know the month is going by but it seem like it's every two weeks.,NEGATIVE
its great to share music and spark creativity. even better you can and have access to podcast that can truly change your life if and when you apply tried and tested principles they teach,POSITIVE
SPOTIFY packs a punch with custom Playlist fitting your qhole day. Gr eat broadcasting and streaming function clarity. Thank you Google.,NEGATIVE
"The app always has the same error ""No internet connection"". I'm using a 5G band wifi, yet I get the same error. Unable to search music due to this. Terrible experience.",NEGATIVE
"On two different brand android phones this app stop playing randomly, doesn't keep track of where you were, goes back to a random point you already liatened to as well. Super annoying when listening to a podcast. Content is excellent, app is trash.",NEGATIVE
9.99 wasn't a bad deal.... Until they started charging my card twice a month.,POSITIVE
"I've seen using Spotify for about 3+ years and I haven't had anything negative to say until now so let's get into it. The only complaint I have is when ever I go into a Playlist to edit it and add a song 'normally' I could get to hear a preview (a small part) or the song, but recently I haven't been able to hear those previews. Either this is due to internet connection, my phone, or a bug/glitch. I do hope that this problem gets fixed because it can be annoying.",NEGATIVE
Awesome music and playlist Variety of artists and genres,POSITIVE
Amazing that I can access so much music in be place,POSITIVE
Quit playing songs that are not in my playlist,NEGATIVE
"I have to log out and sign back in every time the app is closed in order to access my ""Liked Songs"" playlist, otherwise it only shows the few 2-3 I've liked from my desktop, but not the remaining 500 others I literally listen to on the regular...",NEGATIVE
"Great app, really easy to navigate. However, creating playlist and discovering new songs is a NIGHTMARE. They resently removed the feature to preview the song before adding it to your playlist, making it almost impossible to find new songs, which I really dumb. They should add it back. But it's alright for listening on car trips and stuff",POSITIVE
Great way to listen to music but I clearly turned of auto play ( playing songs that aren't in my playlist after it's done) and yet it still plays song that I CLEARY do not have on my playlist. This frustrates me because I can not reset my playlist so I have to play a different playlist then play that playlist so I can go back to MY songs,NEGATIVE
"Great app for listening to music ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜˜it has good music. Every song u need!ðŸ˜ And also,...no annoying ads",POSITIVE
Best app ever for songs but there is so much of ads,NEGATIVE
Updates suck now it a really bad app I don't recommend it.pls fix it,NEGATIVE
Love dis apps but why does my playlist keep disappearing when I have updated the premium program?,NEGATIVE
Since the latest update it keeps randomly stopping and I have to reopen the app to get it to play again. Very frustration when you are trying to listen to a podcast while mowing the lawn or working out.,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming! satisfied with my browses in metal music. Make the other albums available please for the premium users. And please add the Hifi CD-quality already please,POSITIVE
"My experience with Spotify has been great for nearly a year now, but lately, it keeps saying ""no wifi connection"" when it's clearly connected to wifi; it takes forever to load up; and when i tried to reinstall, it took forever to uninstall and reinstall and essentially crashed my phone. It was fine when I managed to log in again, but it kept crashing when I tapped the icon and now I'm going through the forever uninstall stage again. Please fix this!!",NEGATIVE
"Honestly, I just prefer Pandora. I find it easier to use, I like the free premium sessions, and it doesn't have as many ads. Nothings wrong with the app, I'm just not a fan.",NEGATIVE
"Use it on the daily. THANK YOU for adding the artist/decade/genre mixes, so great",POSITIVE
Spotify is good,POSITIVE
Listen to all the best podcasts on Spotify. Love it.,POSITIVE
"Payed version is pretty good, but It has some usability stuff missing, that I can't be bothered to express specifically.",NEGATIVE
"Very good , my favourite songs are available",POSITIVE
kinda glitchy when i close my chromebook and open it back up(refuses to play). I usually have to open and close the app a couple of times to get it to work.,NEGATIVE
Every single Podcaster supercedes the adds you pay not to see.,NEGATIVE
It never lags and there are no ads I love it 5 out of 5,POSITIVE
i like listing to music just make it so you can only watch the ones you want that you saved when you finish you go on some radmon ones,POSITIVE
I love it so much I can download a lot of music and enjoy as much as I can and the price is very affordable â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ˜©,POSITIVE
Everything I expected it to be and more. I was able to find songs i have heard in years. Outstanding ap.,POSITIVE
This is a really good app for listening to your favorite songs and podcast,POSITIVE
I paid for Spotify mini premium but apparently it doesn't work,NEGATIVE
"you know what, I've had Spotify a couple times but the new update sucks I can't listen to my songs without a whole other song playing, I don't want to sound weird but... this is HORRIBLE >:(",NEGATIVE
Great selections and playlists,POSITIVE
Absolutely not working at all since last update,NEGATIVE
I like this. In this u can make playlist listen songs also u can see the lyrics. There are so many songs to hear in one app. I like this the developer did a great job.,POSITIVE
"Never any problems, great array of different genres",POSITIVE
found everything i wanted in this i just loved it #spotify,POSITIVE
It's wonderful that I can listen to music I like with my playlist and put it on loop too,POSITIVE
This containes too many advertisements which ruins the song and it's feel. Without premium the advertisement just come 5 to 6 seconds.,NEGATIVE
Best music streaming app I've come across so far!,POSITIVE
"Enjoy different types of world-wide music! Though I would like to skip the advertisement,lol Highly recommended the broadcast at Spotify",POSITIVE
How to work my device better and good music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
Have loved this app for years now. Top Knotch!,POSITIVE
Nice app to hear good quality songs,POSITIVE
"Normalize volume does not work ,Lyrics don't work for my account tried everything still doesn't work and app is extremely glitchy and I think I'm going to cancel my spotify premium,because they're not trying to do anything to fix their app don't waste your time and money",NEGATIVE
Premium has been gone for several months yet I'm still getting billed for it.,NEGATIVE
Was not able to listen to podcast. Said there was no internet connection. Funny thing is that I had internet connection for everything else I wanted to do online. Not pleased at all.,NEGATIVE
"More ads than music if you aren't paying. Still true with 4+ ads for a song or two. Don't use this app if you like listening to music in the shower, YouTube has shorter ads.",NEGATIVE
"Crystal clear sound and there's not much you can't find, especially in terms of genres.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is amazing.I use for my kids when on road trips, and I use it when I need some time to my self but still need music I give it a 5/5",POSITIVE
I just did an update and I have no way to update my payment option. ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Remove the premium. Please remove the premium for those who can't afford it and hate the ads and the fact that we can't play any song we want without the shuffle in our playlist. Please. Remove. The. Premium.,NEGATIVE
"#WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Spotify has gotten so big that they forgot us little people are the ones that put them in their IVORY TOWERS and GOLDEN THRONES. But they are like the STELLAR ROCKSTARS, and HUGE MOVIE STARS. They only need us little people is when its time to pocket our money.....Whats wrong with this picture????? Its a sad song.",POSITIVE
Bro every time I press on a song it plays a different when it's not what I asked for!! Terrible app please don't download or waste money on buying premium this app is terrible.,NEGATIVE
add friend activity to all versions of the app!!,NEGATIVE
This is one of the best music app that I have download but it is not offline game and you have to have a wifi or load to connect :(,NEGATIVE
Amazing app. Useful for all music needs.,POSITIVE
"Favourite music app, but for some reason, recently my songs have been cutting off 30 seconds early by ads? Like, I'll be listening to a song n 30 seconds before it finishes, an ad comes on and the song ends",NEGATIVE
Shame that the developers won't update the app to allow for themed icon in Android 12. On top of the fact that the daily mixes don't make much sense based on artist selection.,NEGATIVE
Having to reset my phone everytime I get out of my car because the app has recently decided that a pause button is t needed is getting pretty annoying,NEGATIVE
I love that I can play whatever I want whenever I want! I also discover new artists by playing Spotify's suggestions! I never go a day without it!,POSITIVE
Put shuffle play on ya right it the shame sequence over and over. Waste of money. Over 1500 song downloaded yet the same bloody 100 songs on repeat you can even guess what's next like a cd. If it gets sorted I'd be surprised. There should be a â‚¬3.99 version where you can skip songs and download but listen to a 30 sec ad every hour instead of wasting â‚¬9.99 not worth it when you can't burn songs keep them or even have a proper shuffle play,NEGATIVE
Spotify Spotify is the best,POSITIVE
"The app worked great, but once it updated for some reason when I select the song I want to play it does not work at all. I have to close the app multiple times even then it won't play the song. The songs won't load. Please fix.",NEGATIVE
Excellent I definitely recommend Spotify,POSITIVE
Very nice app. I like it. New ðŸ†• song ðŸ¤£ sunya and jio ton lagaya. Anything. But I really like app.,POSITIVE
Most of the time this is my favorite Work-out and Music App. I use Spotify every day sometimes all day. Last week something happened where all it would play were Ads. Super upsetting. Then miraculously it got fixed and now I can listen to Spotify regularly. Thank you Spotify. This really is a great App. Lots of Artists & songs to choose from.,POSITIVE
I'm going to keep this one-star review here until you stop hosting intentionally annoying ads. Also the app is a crazy battery drain for a music app I mean really...,NEGATIVE
why can't i download the entire playlist? it takes a lot of time to download the song one by one.,NEGATIVE
Plays Radom songs that aren't on your playlist and waitt wait it dose that after making you wait thro 10 ads it's so annoying,NEGATIVE
Too many bugs and glitches. If you force me to use your app by monopolizing my favorite podcasts than at least have your app work correctly.,NEGATIVE
"(not a play store bot) This app is good, however some music I try to find doesn't seem to be available meaning that if you have a specific song you like to hear there's a possibility that it won't be In. Not to mention all of the ads that really ruin the experience, they're frequent as well. Overall try out this app if you want, but I do recommend it sense the music can be played without being in the app and there isn't anything else out there better.",NEGATIVE
Since the Android newest update today on my phone. Spotify doesn't even play or play my playlist..it shows as empty. I hope it gets fixed cause I been having the Spotify app on my phone for many years and I would hate to leave y'all.,NEGATIVE
Very good app but to skip is just sad but other than that awesome appðŸ’¯â¤,POSITIVE
I love the fact that there is roughly 1300 different music genres world wide. And that because of apps like this it's all accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to listen. Beautiful !!!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’¿ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¥ðŸŽºðŸ”£ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"It's good, but one thing that makes me almost despise the app is when you create a playlist, it adds stupid songs that you have to listen too. Add a feature were you can have an option for additional songs. Because it's really frustrating and annoying.",NEGATIVE
Best free music and better when you pay for the full package.,NEGATIVE
Horrible app to use. Literally unusable in the free version.,NEGATIVE
"Good app, good content, swipe added!",POSITIVE
"Good app, just sucks without payment, it just kinda seems stupid how you can't listen to a specific song, and how having your own playlist doesn't matter cause all it will play is recommended songs. But ya, with a payment plan, it's good. Without one, it sucks",NEGATIVE
I can't play my own music from my phone unless downloaded songs why???,NEGATIVE
"It's a good App, now I can listen to music without having Internet, thank to premium",POSITIVE
"Dear spotify, please remove archewell audio. We shouldn't listen to liars.",NEGATIVE
"My wife and I are both using the free version and we love it. You can find almost any song you want from any era you want. You can make playlists which I love. Having a pumped up workout playlist really helps in the mornings and I create my own radio for work with my office tunes playlist. I'm a Big fan of this app. If you love music, you will also love this app.",POSITIVE
I like Spotify it's great ðŸ‘ music app,POSITIVE
It's a shame you play more advertisements than music now.,NEGATIVE
Love the Music & it's so clear! Music to sooth the savage beast!!,POSITIVE
a lot of commercials lately,NEGATIVE
"The app is terrible. Crashes nonstop. Once I hit play, I cant pause.",NEGATIVE
Every next update is even worse! Time to load now is about 2 minutes...,NEGATIVE
I really like this app this a best app I love Spotify â¤ ðŸ˜ ðŸ’–,POSITIVE
"I don't need to hear religious ads, skip option should be available. Keep ads neutral.",NEGATIVE
"It has a massive collection of songs to choose from and great suggestions for what ever type of music you like, plus it has podcasts which can be very enjoyable to listen to, I strongly recommend it if you enjoy music.ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
Awesome . pretty much all the music I wanted to listen,POSITIVE
I love listening to Spotify. They have all kinds of music! Music from when I was a teenager on up and it's great even some oldies golden oldies,POSITIVE
Spotify is great app music is great too many ads tho I would recommend mutify if you cannot afford Spotify premium,NEGATIVE
Love being able to listen to all the music I love.,POSITIVE
"I have over 2000 songs on my Liked songs playlist.. shuffling doesnt exist. No matter how many times i reshuffle my playlist, it still plays the same handful of songs. Absolutely ridiculous",NEGATIVE
I don't know who thought it was a good idea to move the pause/play button to the left and the skip buttons to the right but it just looks ugly,NEGATIVE
I Spotify I depend on it for my spin classes. Walking and entertainment,POSITIVE
My net is on and Spotify app shows that you are offline,NEGATIVE
I cant play my liked songs playlist.,NEGATIVE
And it's beautiful cuz it has every music in and there,POSITIVE
If I want to play my music I'll turn it on when I'm ready I'm tired of this s*** coming on whenever it gets ready f*** that I'm about to delete this app,NEGATIVE
Spotify doesn't disappoint. I depend on Spotify to keep me going at work 10-14 hrs a night. The large collection of choices make it possible to never have to repeat a podcast or music line up BUT Still have the option if I choose to repeat. Thnx Spotify for helping me focus.,POSITIVE
"Why does this app have to update EVERY SINGLE DAY ? This is VERY ANNOYING ! It is a good way to listen to music, but IT UPDATES EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHY ?",NEGATIVE
"Experience is great until you play back your liked songs under shuffle. Over 700 liked songs and it only plays about 40-60 of them and then repeats. Very frustrating to hearthe same song 3 times in 4 hours. I'd I wanted repeats, I'd listen to fm radio LOL",NEGATIVE
"I uninstalled this! After i left a 2 star review, ads became more frequent! Free version has more ads than FM radio. Time to try PANDORA.",NEGATIVE
It doesn't allow you to skip,POSITIVE
Add a filter function on Playlists which allows you to play only the non-explicit portions of Playlists.,NEGATIVE
All of my songs in one app! It's amazing! Spotify even chooses songs similar to the song I played,POSITIVE
"I've always loved spotify. And it's even more accessible on my phone. I highly recommend it to any, and everyone who enjoys music.",POSITIVE
Please fix the shuffle function - it's literally been broken for years. I have to uninstall and reinstall often. Please fix this basic function,NEGATIVE
Good music and I love how it can be played in the background.,POSITIVE
From my experience with music apps this is definitely the clear winner! Keep up the good work guys. John x,POSITIVE
I've had this app for a long time and I've never had any problems with it,POSITIVE
"Update: the prev problems seemed to be fixed. The only issue I'm seeing now is that the podcast that I listen to won't always be marked as ""played"" and if I do sort the played ones out it doesn't always filter them out the 1st time. Old: I really want to give this app a 5 because I use it every day and I want it to be better but it's been acting up lately and I've been getting frustrated with it. For the most part it's a great app. There's a wide variety of artists and sounds great.",POSITIVE
Doesnt let you choose which favourite songs you want to play.,NEGATIVE
"Covid vaccine propaganda push in this app is so ridiculous, i had to give it a 1 star and delete. App is terrible.",NEGATIVE
"got locked out and cant get back in. also, you should let me see if a song is the right thing instead of shuffling it with random songs before adding to a playlist.",NEGATIVE
Horrible. Worthless. No updates. Podcasts restart. App always out of sync. Constantly force closing app and restarting. NO SUPPORT!!!!! WORTHLESS!!! Everytime your phone or Spotify updates good lucky having the app work as advertised!! Take my money and screw me over all in one motion. Way to go Spotify! UPDATE: 6/13/22 SHUFFLE HAS STOPPED WORKING AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF COMING BACK. WAY TO GO SPOTFY!,NEGATIVE
Newest update wont let me play my music and when i got to any playlist it shows up empty ive restarted and reinstalled the app and nothing. SPOTIFY FIX YOUR APP ... IVE BEEN PAYING PREMIUM FOR BROKEN MERCH THIS IS RIDICULOUS !!!!,NEGATIVE
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify and it's truly a great app. My only problem is that I've been getting way too many ads. If I skip a song, I have to wait for 4 or 5 ads to play, then get back to whatever song I wanted to listen to. At this point, even YouTube is better for playing music.",POSITIVE
Go to music app in love with the premium.,POSITIVE
I recommend premium idk if it does it anyways but it takes all the songs you ever listened to the most for that year and puts them in a playlist,POSITIVE
"Now playing screen on the tab s7 plus is only using half of the screen in landscape orientation, causing all of the buttons to be squished together and difficult to use. This UI issue has been going on for about a month now. Please fix!",NEGATIVE
When you beg for ratings you get bad ones. Also just let me play one specific song.,NEGATIVE
"Any song, any time, no ads. I love my Spotify, it's with the price!",NEGATIVE
Have used the app for years no issues now all of a sudden all my songs have vanished and I can not play anything on the app. Very frustrating was on support Chat for 3 hours and got no where with them!!! I now can not use the app on my phone and have to go thru the internet. ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
"Good app for music, too many ads though",NEGATIVE
I pay 10 bucks a month to listen to music's that I don't own ad free. I should at least have the ability to listen on multiple devices at one time. What's the hold up on an update like this? Another idea. How about a remove from Playlist option.,NEGATIVE
I Freakin love Spotify!!! It's PERFECT listen to ALL my favorites songs. I am a True Music lover from Old school to the newest I can't complain ðŸ’¯ satisfaction!,POSITIVE
Absolutely amazing the best I could ask for however some more songs could be added but I'm pleased.,POSITIVE
The shuffle could work better sometimes I hear the same song Within the hour,NEGATIVE
"I loved this app up until they made stupid changes to appease Adelle ðŸ™„ðŸ¤¬ Seriously, put the app back to the way it was where I could skip a song I didn't want to hear at the moment! Now, in place of that button it just pauses/restarts the same song ðŸ™„ Almost caused a wreck trying to find out to skip a damn song now!",NEGATIVE
Love the clarity of music,POSITIVE
If you want to listen to music this is the one,POSITIVE
No boring ads JUST MUSIC. So easy.,POSITIVE
Keeps abruptly stopping,NEGATIVE
"I hate this new update!! I can't even listen to my favorite songs anymore without it having to shuffle it to another, and so I had decided to make a playlist with just one song in it so I could listen to it but spotify decided to add more songs to it that I dont even like and I cant even listen to the songs I like anymore, I used to love using spotify but now I hate it ever since this stupid update came out! I'm not using this app anymore until they fix this trashy update!",NEGATIVE

"Its worse app m trying from yesterday neither I can't search any song nor able to play songs in my playlist eyery time it pop up ""oops!! Something went wrong"" . Disgusting!! Not it's trouble playing my songs I don't it stop in the middle of any song Disgusting application",NEGATIVE
"One star until we are allowed to play one song at the time AGAIN LIKE HOW IT USED TO BE. I search for a particular song, then boom you told me to play the whole playlist? Also stop adding new songs into playlist that we created, its annoying!",NEGATIVE
Its 100% better then the original app uses data and works faster its so amazing i glad to say that spotify lite is way way much better,POSITIVE
Let us play one song at a time! We Don't want to shuffle for the playlist or listen to a whole bunch of songs and plus when we have a playlist you add new songs to it it sucks stop doing it! Just get rid of that stuff and let it be normal again please!,NEGATIVE
"I love this app! But it has had a glitch on the daily mixes when when it shows the next song it skips to another song that's ahead or backwards, I would really appreciate if you would fix that problem.",NEGATIVE
"Low price a month for music ,podcasts etc...never thaught mutch of it until i got spotify .no ads and thats the BEST part no interruptions while listening to music or podcasts...alot of albums and artists. Only problem is ,its hard to find bass bossted or mixed songs because its not made by the artist .",NEGATIVE
"Uninstalling Spotify because it automatically starts playing my call recording, even though I have never gave it any such permission.",NEGATIVE
"Has to stop playing me russian songs ! I only have Ukrainian songs in my lists, but more than half the songs it's reccomending are russian...",NEGATIVE
It gets irritating when you look up a song where want to play your playlist and and music you don't have on the playlist where the songia woke up doesn't play but other songs do because it's song spotify thinks You would like I am trying the 3 month Samsung trial I trial which I don't even know what it's for because it won't let me skip songs and let's we have ads And it doesn't even allow me to listen to my playlist without the songs that are added by spotify.,NEGATIVE
An amazing app for music lovers ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
So easy to use and so good cause ypu can listen to music even when you're phone is turned off and when on other apps,POSITIVE
It's so annoying!!when you try to listen to a song it gives a completely different playlist and when u make a playlist it adds songs that you didn't even put in!You also only get 6 skips (to skip a song) per hour!! why should we need a limited skip??,NEGATIVE
The app is good for music but i hate the fact they add music for you and whenever i play my playlist it plays random music they haven't added neither i have and the 6 skips per hour is also pointless.,NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify, and the student discount for premium.",POSITIVE
I feel like it was easier to make playlists before.,NEGATIVE

Such a wonderful application. I always get what I want to listen. I am truly impressed with this music platform.,POSITIVE
Stop telling me to join some rando's session everytime i listen to Spotify at work. In fact give me option to disable that feature all together,NEGATIVE
"It's been like a year and a half since I doawnload spotify at first it was amazing, unlimited skips, no shuffle play, you can skip mins or secs in a song, and rarely ads. But now every 2 songs there's an ad, only 6 skips an hour just to get the same songs all the day, can't skip mins or secs. On playstation its incredible because we still have the ability to skip etc... It's still a great app but we need more of the accessibilies that premium has",NEGATIVE
I love being able to create my own playlists. I have over 50 in different music genres. Having the commercial-free Premium Package is the best of all!ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ¤©,POSITIVE
The app is to good but I again and again shows no network connection also when I have i good network connection,NEGATIVE
canvas option doesn't appear in the app and it used to work ok,NEGATIVE
Its a great app but it's hard to use please I would like to suggest to change the playlist and make it like the one like on the likes on the library because it's very hard for me to play music and it irritates me because I can't play the full song when I click it it just play a few part of the song with irritates me more since music is where I go so I can relax or sleep too but all and all its a great app,NEGATIVE
"My profile doesn't even show up, and my playlists don't show up. It's been going on for months. Only the app has the problem, I can use the website just fine",POSITIVE
Started freezing when I open app. Going back to piracy since y'all suck.,NEGATIVE

"After this most recent update, Spotify will open, show my recent listening, but when I click on any of them, it won't play. Also my playlists show up as empty and when I click on a recently listened-to artist, it never loads the page. .. This is only on my Samsung phone with the most recently released version of Spotify.

"Hot garbage. Please dont support them by buying premium, they dont deserve it.",NEGATIVE

"I use this app on a daily basis for music. Trying to listen to podcasts is increasingly difficult though. The ads within the episodes are almost twice the volume of the people telling the podcast, making it very difficult to want to listen to them.",NEGATIVE
"Used to be great. Bring back the separate play and shuffle play buttons, it's such a pain realising you've hit shuffle. Having to turn off loads of features just to keep your sanity sucks. Auto mixing, playing similar music once an album or playlist has finished shouldn't be on my default. Stop changing things for the sake of it. This should be about playing music, not working out how to turn off a new dumb feature. I know companies your size won't act on a person's review or even reply,",NEGATIVE

Good selection of all type of music.,POSITIVE

"I've been unable to renew my subscription even after I switched banks. Right now, I cannot even see the option to add my card details. This has been going on for weeks now. What's the issue?",NEGATIVE
"Very clunky and fragile. Needs rebooting a lot to get the correct ""now playing"" screen, which often disappears. For some reason, when wanting to play an album from beginning to end, after the first song, it just starts playing something random from a Playlist with no reason. Also, it doesn't take much for it to start buffering, despite having full and strong signal. Please fix these issues ASAP.",NEGATIVE

It takes two attempts to open this app in Android Auto. If I am using I heart radio it won't switch to Spotify on the first try. It always takes two pokes at the Spotify button to open Spotify. This has been corrected.,NEGATIVE
So far the apps works fine. Please strike a deal with Umobile Malaysia so that I can subscribe from them and don't need to buy gift card anymore for 3 months subscribtion. TQ Spotify,POSITIVE

Listening to Spotify is like having the best sound quality system,POSITIVE
"Edit: as of June 13, 2022, there have been two more updates, and now nothing will download. If this isn't resolved soon, I will cancel my premium account and go to Amazon Music.

I have updated the app on June 7, 2022, and still have these issues.",NEGATIVE

"Decent, when it works. It's always been buggy, but now it straight up deletes my offline music on my galaxy watch. One of the primary features of the app. It's like no one at Spotify does UAT before posting updates.",NEGATIVE

"I decided to pay for Spotify premium at the start of lockdown 2020 and I haven't looked back. The amount of music available is immense. I enjoy putting together my own play lists and listening to them in the car. The downside is a moral one. I simply don't need to buy records, mp3's or CDs anymore and I don't think Spotify pay the musicians a fair price for the talent and creative genius the musicians provide. I pay monthly for premium and 90% of that monthly fee needs to go to the entertainers.",NEGATIVE
When I search for a song and I try to play it it never played that same song at least you have to listen five bs song before it pays the song you want to play,NEGATIVE
I am not able to update my payments for the past 2 months just debugging all credit card and indicating there is no service or network problem,NEGATIVE
His app is not working . When ever I play a song . Then the close. Please do something.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a phenomenal app if you paid for premium.

You have to shufle through the album to listen to it. Why do i have to pay to get rid of this suffering?",NEGATIVE
"Ads after 6 ,7 songs and they say 30 mins without intereption but they still play ads in between that ðŸ¥²",NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, makes it easier for me to explore a variety of music. Plus the ads aren't much. â¤ï¸ â¤ï¸ â¤ï¸",NEGATIVE
"Best app on earth, but why is the album art blurry? I want to see those images in 4K (13 June 2022)",NEGATIVE

"I live somalia,this app is not available your country says so Spotify i can't use in somalia spotify is boring",NEGATIVE
Everytime I want to play a song a different song is covering the song I wanna play,POSITIVE
This app is the best app for music. The library is customized very well according to the user's needs and has curated Playlists as well only for the user based on their music taste. If u listen to music very often then u should buy the premium plan as the ads get really annoying but if u listen like rarely then the free plan with ads is the better choice. It's a fantastic app and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves music.,POSITIVE
You need to work hard on bug fixes The app tends to lag most of the time Sometimes I've to restart my phone to play music I can't afford premium so what so many ads but I'm still using this app,NEGATIVE

Fix the app i cant see the shuffle button on my playlist when i got to the settings i cant see the autoplay,NEGATIVE
"Whenever I open a playlist it says 'This playlist is empty' in every playlist, nor any song is playing please fix the issue as soon as possible.",NEGATIVE
"This app refuses to work. All home page playlists show as empty, none of my playlists show up in my library, the app spins forever instead of playing anything, and attempting to make a playlist immediately crashes the app. I also cannot open playlists that others have created. I don't know why anyone would use this if you cannot even play a single song.",NEGATIVE
I like the app it's just annoying how ads all ways come it it won't let me choose the sond I'm trying to play its plays something I do t want to listen to,NEGATIVE
"It won't let me play any playlist are songs and it won't let me look or even listen to my life songs.

Essentially a good app but there are certain flawd when we cast the app on pc browser and firetv Spotify. The songs don't stay in sync even though the internet connection is really powerful. Also many many songs don't have lyrics. Many songs used to have lyrics with them but then the lyrics disappeared. Otherwise it's good ... Better than all of the others.,NEGATIVE
Too many ads.. even after 1 song ðŸ˜”,NEGATIVE
Very relax all the music whenever u are..,POSITIVE
Good Music quality and less ads good app,NEGATIVE
Any song I have looked up they have and any artist so I recommend this app to anybody it's great when I go to the gym,POSITIVE

There is way to much ads on mobile also i dont like that we cant listen to out like songs,NEGATIVE
"Best way to find new music you like! I've just had the app for a few weeks and have already found two new artists I love! The ads and inability to skip certain songs can be bothersome, but the app usually knows your musical taste enough for you to not really want to skip songs in the first place.",POSITIVE
My phone got restart when I open Spotify. Please resolve it quickly,NEGATIVE
Great music app.,POSITIVE
I don't know how people use this terrible app. Listen to YouTube or make your own Playlist on your phone. Terribly setup and crashes/freezes my computer the second the page loads. I stopped watching Joe Rogan cuz he switched to this trash.,NEGATIVE
"Poor user experience lately, it doesn't show any play-bar so I could control a play and it's very frustrating, I have to close the app every time I want to pause a song and re-open and find it again when I want to play it - instead of having the pause/play option! Plus I can't move on different times of the play so if I want to go back to a middle of a podcast episode - on Spotify I just can't! Is it going to be fixed?? That's embarrassing consider tha apps cost and how fundamental the feature.",NEGATIVE
It's an awesome music platform,POSITIVE
"I love this app alot but I'm having some problems from last 3 months it says ""no internet connection available"" I'm always connected to the wifi bit still, other apps works but it doesn't I want you to fix this as soon as possible please",NEGATIVE
"I use it for a while but it still don't know what music I like. It just spams my account with the ""popular"" songs. And I don't think there's just USA music in the world. The app is not sleeping but keeps stopping..",NEGATIVE
Nice music app thank you spotify.,POSITIVE
"When I search up a song right and I click on it, it doesn't even play on the right song",NEGATIVE
"Sup. So I reinstalled this and now I'm aware of why I uninstalled to begin with...Well basically I work graveshift at a store, restocking etc. The store has wifi that runs just fine, but Spotify refuses to acknowledge the fact that I'm connected. That's very annoying since I like to listen to music while working. So maybe, just maybe...Fix your app? Ps ditch the ads. They don't help a mood. (EX. Listening to Juice WRLD and then some happy sunshine ad plays. Not ideal huh.)",NEGATIVE
After signing up I received an offer of $9.99 a month for one year of the premium service. Went to sign up the next day and the price jumped to $24.95 per month . Couldn't get support for my issue so I deleted the App.,NEGATIVE
I love this app u can turn ur phone off and still hear the song it doesn't turn off,POSITIVE
"App doesn't work at all in offline mode, won't play any music unless I start a downloaded podcast, then add music to the queue, then use the queue to select a song.

I like Spotify because I don't know any better,POSITIVE
Great wifi & being the only app opened yet still struggles to play songs. Never had this problem before (Premium),POSITIVE
"I really enjoy Spotify. The premiem package is the way to go so you'll have access to all the content plus more control when it's comes to playing music. The other package sucks. No control over music, just random . I only give it 4 stars because the free package sucked.",NEGATIVE
Amazing! I'm able to replay my favorite songs,POSITIVE
I love this app but the way there is like 4 adds after one skip even tho it promises to give me 30 minutes of add free music pisses me tf off. App is okay tho ig,POSITIVE

All the feature of this app is fine and everything which should be in a song app but its only one thing is bad and that is its mood dependent song. This means that the next song to come does not depend on the mood that we want to hear. so fix it. I Hope You Can Fix It #spotifyteam,NEGATIVE
Luv it Downloaded it for special podcast by Erin Bailey...She is awesome..,POSITIVE
"Really great app, even if you don't want to pay for premium the only really annoying thing is that you can't look up individual songs, but even that is manageable overall great app.",POSITIVE
Works well. Ads can be annoying. But otherwise nice.,POSITIVE
"It's ok, I use it for podcasts and it plays them well enough. There are 2 issues, 1/ when not connected to the internet it stuffs up a lot 2/ recently it plays an ad for other pods every 5mins which is too often and really annoying.",POSITIVE
"Nothing negative to say, but on the song ""crown"" by collective soul it plays, but then it stops for a min and plays another song, just seeing if that can be fixed.",NEGATIVE
Good music featured wide by selection,POSITIVE
I'm unable to go online even though my connection is alright. It says in the app that i should go online and try again. Unable to play songs! Neither online or offline but I'm able to play podcast. This is so disappointing ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸. Why aren't you working on this. Utterly frustrated. App crashing repeatedly.,NEGATIVE
"Everything is okay,but....add is a bit annoying.Anyway to listen music.spotify is the best",POSITIVE

"It's great the app has everything has high minority of the songs on it the odd few that isn't on it, but ever so rencely the app keeps crashing out of nowhere while the songs are play, I'm not sure if it has a bug or something in it I've keeped looking to see if updates to fix it nothing as of yet.",NEGATIVE
Its amazing but when I'm trying to listen to my music there are random songs I didn't want and I don't like on the list.,NEGATIVE
"Downloaded songs and playlists are useless when the connection is lost. No matter how many times you restart the app, it bugs out and keeps giving an ""offline"" error. This started happening a couple of months ago and never got better with any update so far.",NEGATIVE
Making a fun and diverse Playlist has never been easier â¤,POSITIVE
Everytime I use Spotify my music always change into something that it's not on my list of music not sure why but they gotta fix this bug cause I been paying monthly just to keep my music,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify Any song any time from wherever you want to be Spotify is the best,POSITIVE

"Super buggy on watch, doesn't download the songs to it 50% of the time. Response on phone is sluggish. Junk app.",NEGATIVE
The best music streaming app if you have premium,POSITIVE
"Nowadays it is not good,it will ask so many times login and it takes more time to play the music",NEGATIVE
"Thanks for updating the coding, finally able too hear from songs on my liked list, that were never heard before, instead of the same rotation. ðŸ¤—ðŸ‘‚ðŸ–– Heads up too others, if Spotify is working well on your phone, be wary of updating, it can really be a downer, if you update, and the Gremlins appear. ðŸ¥°",NEGATIVE
Free listening with high quality sound. Really good,POSITIVE
This app randomly keeps going offline and takes ages to get online. Thats annoying since I've definitely got a connection.,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, I mostly use it on my Chromebook because on computer it's sorta like premium except the audio quality isn't as good as premium",NEGATIVE
Love all the music that's available.,POSITIVE
Love The Dream. First podcast to listen to. It has helped me cope with my nightmare of MLM. I know now I'm not alone.,POSITIVE
Way too many commercials. Not worth using.,NEGATIVE
I love the song recommendationâ™¡â™¡,POSITIVE
Absolutely perfect app,POSITIVE
"Pretty good music app for creating preset playlists, very easy to use. The main complaint I have is that, unlike in the computer version, there is no way to disable it creating playlists, meaning I'd you want to listen to just a particular song you have to skip through multiple other songs, using up your daily skips if you are a free listener. Also sometimes it will bombard you with two or three ads in a row after you skip a song. Overall, however, I enjoy this app",POSITIVE
Great app to use weather it's on the go or at home doing chores.,POSITIVE
Would be 5 but since updates it stops playing when my screen times out.,NEGATIVE
"Its an okay app, But whenever i try to add a song to my playlist the app crashes. Spotify is a good app aside from this problem, Please fix this glitch. Thank you!",POSITIVE
Really good app to listen online music,POSITIVE
It plays random songs that are not even in my Playlist. It skips songs half way through.,NEGATIVE
It's saying I'm not connected to wifi and not letting me play any music. It also deleted all my playlists.,NEGATIVE

"I had a small problem about a month ago with the app not working right with my blue tooth but all that started working right now. My phone updated yesterday. Now my Spotify won't work at all so I uninstalled it then reinstalled it, logged in and all of my music is GONE. Now I have start all over or get another music app. I am not happy and I am paying for it. That will stop.",NEGATIVE
This app won't let me log back in. Tgis and the spotify for artists app. I'm not sure what to do,NEGATIVE
No one would like spotify. Streaming quality is superior.,NEGATIVE
It was a good app until the update. Just gonna move to soundcloud lol atleast it lets me pick songs and skip them,NEGATIVE
"I like using this app, nothing is bugging, crashing or causing errors, everything is great. The only thing I complain about is the ""Shuffle"" button in my playlists. I can't select a song on my own because Spotify plays random songs itself,no matter what cover I click, it will autoplay what the cover sounds like and then stop. This may not happen if you buy premium, however not everyone can afford it. My conclusion is that Spotify needs a feature where shuffling is an optional and not permanent.",NEGATIVE
Excellent and exceptional,POSITIVE
not for listen songs just see advertisentsðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE

My one fav app because I can listen all the time with my fav song but when the other update come I got irritated because I can't pick on my own......... How can I listen to my fav songs...?,NEGATIVE

"I love all the music in here, and had a lot of choices. And i always subcribe to the premium so i can download the song that i want.",POSITIVE
"Beyond my expectations , I'm not very technical so they've made it easy and helpful , thanks",POSITIVE
If you want a basic music app this is a good app but it sucks on mobile when you don't have premium,NEGATIVE
I'm happy and grateful cause all characteristics of songs that I research here I find it,POSITIVE
This is a great app for music,POSITIVE
I love Spotify and how easy to use it is. And the best part is no commercials. I'm a big fan. Thanks for the great music! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¼ðŸ˜€,POSITIVE

It a really good app but then there premiun why can everything be free and you can't pick what song you want to lissting to what you have on your own play list when on laptop or computer so I can't stand this app ðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and good selection,POSITIVE
"Dropped youtube music app for Spotify I haven't been disappointed,$9.99 per month that I pay is a great price to get to listen to what you want with zero adds bombarding you..bravo Spotify on a great fantastic app highly recommended..",POSITIVE
I hate how it plays a diffrent song sometimes and that its only avalable fr premium subscription but its a great app,POSITIVE
It's so annoying like I want to plat music and the skips and the ads its just stupid how you get sic skips then I just go on YouTube instead,NEGATIVE
Too many ads even for it being free,NEGATIVE
If i wanted to listen to music online id go to youtube useless app unless youre willing to pay,NEGATIVE
It'd be 5 stars if you had the option to disable personalised *radios*. It creates the most atrocious playlists.,NEGATIVE
"Use it ever night to fall a sleep I'm now sitting pool side listening to all my favorite songs from the 50 60,",NEGATIVE
Great experience so far lots of music. Im also able to make a play list or queu music over all would recommend.,POSITIVE
This apps been really good although there's been an ongoing issue where whenever I go onto a playlist none of the songs show up meaning I cannot remove any songs and can only shuffle through them i would continue using this app if the bug is fixed (also I don't use premium and I'm on android),NEGATIVE
"One of the best music app's I ever used, although without a subscription the ads will get very annoying, but overall I love it and also how they added the file feature so there's no limit to what you can listen to.",POSITIVE
"Truly enjoying Spotify, I have over 80 hours of hits, only issue is app doesn't play every song on the Playlist, it appears to be on about a 20 song loop. I've seen that many other users have that same issue. Please correct that. Thx!",NEGATIVE
"Just lost my wife of 58 years. Spotify is helping with the grief, The unbelievable grief.",POSITIVE
"It used to be amazing! Like I had no complaints for my OnePlus 3t and OnePlus 8 but recently it's just become close to unusable, half the time the player you get on the home screen doesn't appear then when you go on the app you can hear music but there is no way to stop it without force closing the app, and there are so many small UX issues, eg. when scrolling it doesn't always allow you to get to the bottom, for an app I pay Â£10 a month for after 5 years I'm really considering moving.",NEGATIVE
"I love this app , the variety is executed. Thanks",POSITIVE
Is fast but the playlist update is the problem,NEGATIVE
"New phone and my account didn't save and or cross over, lost all my play lists.......unsatisfactory!!!",NEGATIVE
I can't even hear the music I want now I can't even skip the songs I don't want to hear this is good only fo the first day,POSITIVE
Is really good I can find all my music on there,POSITIVE
If you want a free mobile music app then skip this as it is terrible. Can only stream 2 songs before the app forces 5+ ads.,NEGATIVE
Still going. I'm still listening. Keep things affordable.. otherwise people would leave.,POSITIVE
"I'm able to find and listen to the most obscure music here, love it.",POSITIVE
"It's alright, but you can't preview a song anymore, which I quite liked for expanding my taste",POSITIVE

This is a new phone had it on my other phone loved it.os there away to get my Playlist off my other phone that at has spootify.,NEGATIVE
I am enjoying it so much so that I take my phone to shower and just listen to my Playlists,POSITIVE
The best app on my life because it has so many songs for me to know learn and listen also it is so relaxing to just hear my Playlist (I still don't know how to make my Playlist btw) anyway the app is amazingly super super cool,POSITIVE
It was fine when I started using it but now there are ads after every song not like it says that add free listning for 30 min apart from that its great ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
This app is used to be good until these certain problems started happening... it sometimes pause music by itself and sometimes it don't play the next song on the Playlist automatically meaning you have to stop what your doing to go to the next also sometimes when it pause by itself it restarts the whole song,NEGATIVE
This stupid app has been harassing me about a podcast I already listened to for weeks and keeps bringing it up to listen again.,NEGATIVE
The ads keep playing over and over and you cannot pass them. Horrible.,NEGATIVE
"Usally I would give this app an all around 5 stars, However for some reason it has been so buggy lately in so many ways it seems that it is too ridicolus for me to give a full 5 starts. Honestly it's frustrating when I've had to uninstall and reinstall at least 4 times already just to get it to work good for even a few more days.",NEGATIVE
I love it sad thing it needs wifi connection to be able to listen to music and also.. It outs random songs inmy play list and none of my sings in my play list gets played its like it doesn't exist Spotify help,NEGATIVE
"Keeps me and work(WFH)going, always and also when on the road(driving or running).",POSITIVE
Too many ads. Even YouTube has less ads.,NEGATIVE
I am very happy with Spotify it works flawlessly!,POSITIVE

"What's happening!!! My music stops, never happened before...I have premium and maybe I should reconsider this app, it was acting great! What the hell spotify!Spotify!!",POSITIVE
I love it. I use nothing else for music.,POSITIVE
i hate it wen i want to listen to one specific song it plays a random one insted ðŸ˜¡,NEGATIVE
Would give 5 star if they had less ads honestly ruins the app and in 2022 only rich people cab afford premium bc we all broke,NEGATIVE
The hardest to navigate app I have ever used. I use it almost daily and still aways have issues navigating.,NEGATIVE
Good service but the performance of the app is abysmal.,NEGATIVE
Amazing app can find any song any artist love love love this app,POSITIVE
Easy to get around app but music to add ratio is more adds that music,POSITIVE
I can't play my downloaded songs offline any more.. Start playing songs I don't like neither know once my data is on.. I hate this app now .. Rubbish,NEGATIVE
"I like all the music, but the advertisements are SUPER repetitive.... like you hear the same 3 and WAY more than you expect... not sure if it's really less than the radio.",NEGATIVE
This app is stressing me out keeps putting songs into my playlist and i don't know how to stop the song from playing its really annoying and since im new to the app its just way to hard,NEGATIVE
its keeps on telling me app doesn't has stopped and doesn't want to play any songs.,NEGATIVE
"Currently isn't picking up where I left off on podcasts, plays an ad right when I start then jumps to a random spot in the podcast or changes to the next one. Used to work beautifully. Now not so much.",NEGATIVE
"Using a Galaxy A50 android phone and a Premium subscriber. Phone just upgraded its firmware a few days ago and now Spotify app doesn't work. I can get everything from my account on the website but app is haywire. I've tried reinstall, clean reinstall and everything else listed...nothing. I can't get anyone from Spotify to help. Not happy.",NEGATIVE
Half hour without ads and wonderful choice of music that I can blend easily!,POSITIVE
They have the best commercial,POSITIVE
"With premium, I was able to listen to music freely and with the lyrics I could learn the song so I could listen to it. Spotify is the best app to stream music",POSITIVE
Best music app by far! I wish I would've used Spotify sooner!,NEGATIVE
"I was never into the streaming thing! Give me a cd and I'm happy! But cars are changing with no cd players in then. Spotify, at first, was a gift and it is great! You can find more music than you can even remember! It has turned me on to bands I've never heard of and never would have found them had it not been foe Spotify!",POSITIVE
Very good music service but if you dont have the premium version the ads get very annoying and the 6 skips per hour is not really enough.,NEGATIVE
Its good but i wish it was ofline music like audiomac,NEGATIVE
"The sound quality is amazing , I've been using the app for some time now. There is a major issue with the network and loading , all other apps (including other music apps) work absolutely fine on my phone with the current network. Except Spotify , it doesn't load at all. After many attempts at restarting the app , it sometimes works well. No problems with any other features though ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
Need this feature on urgent basis - Adding a favourite is a single tap but removing it is a double tap (maybe ask confirmation before removal). Just bought PRO membership.,NEGATIVE
There should be no ads at all. Premium dosent make sence but it's ok,POSITIVE
Love listening to book and music. They have a very good selection. Very easy to use.,POSITIVE
"Nice music app, but the skips for free accounts should be more.",NEGATIVE
Last few days it wont let me look at my notifications or playlist. It wont let me play music at all. Its not my wifi and it doesnt tell me to check my internet connection. Its a app problem not the wifi.,NEGATIVE
"It's so very easy and simple to get the songs you want, easy to make playlist as well. I don't mind using data listening to good music.",POSITIVE
Ads. Just ads. Fix that,NEGATIVE
"You NEED a subscripction to choose a song and there UI makes it impossible to listen to 1 song, and if your playlists has under 15 songs without the subscription THEY ADD SONGS YOU DONT WANT they make it like an EA game",NEGATIVE
"Offline functionality is virtually non-existent. I downloaded a bunch of podcasts for a 12hr drive, as I have limited data and thought it would be perfect. After driving through areas with poor reception i noticed that my podcasts would stop. It said they were downloaded, but actually they weren't. I tried several times again, and Spotify seems to choke up on anything downloaded. How can i justify paying for the premium version if they can't get downloads right? I miss my iphone w/ Apple podcast",NEGATIVE
Loving the music. Thanks,POSITIVE
"Always using this app, have done for years it's great!",POSITIVE
Love music and Spotify has it!,POSITIVE
The best music app there is,POSITIVE
"I have loved this app for years. Have never had a problem, until recently. I use Spotify on my laptop, desktop, Roku, and Android. I have no idea what's going on, but the mobile Android app shows empty playlists, whether it's a playlist I created or a Spotify playlist such as Daily Mix or Release Radar. I am able to see and play all playlists on every other device I use, just not my android. Also, I keep getting an error message that I'm not connected to internet on the Android app. Help??",NEGATIVE
It's taking long time while searching songs... And don't all song collection... Very very disappointed,NEGATIVE
This app is nice because you can play songs you like/love I love it,POSITIVE
Spotify is a great app.,POSITIVE
"Add song feature dont work, as it doesn't play chorus of the song.",NEGATIVE
"Such a foolish thing for such a big name, the all automatically switches audio to my earphones while Its playing on my smart speaker",NEGATIVE
I thought adverts for people who have the free version where supposed to be every 30 minutes and not every 10 minutes (every 2 to 3 songs),NEGATIVE
"AMAZING Music Application,I've been with Spotify premium for a while now!. A helluva ðŸï¸ðŸï¸Ride !ðŸï¸ðŸï¸. And love the service it's provided!ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Žâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸ Edit: sorry for the low rating. I haven't updated this in years ! STILL A HELLUVA RIDE!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Love this service till the end of my life!ðŸƒðŸŒ¿",POSITIVE
"I started using the app in 2021 and I enjoyed great functionality and overall convenience, my gripe is that my payments won't go through on all my debit cards so I don't have access to premium services.",POSITIVE
Best music streaming service ever,POSITIVE
"Downloaded music won't play without an internet connection. It used to, which allowed me to listen at work, but not anymore.",NEGATIVE
"I subscribe so don't have any issue with ads and it's well worth it. Most tracks are on Spotify and only a rare few aren't available due to copyright. I have a large collection of CDs and rarely play them, I can control what I listen to from my phone, play an entire album, 1 track, one of my playlists or programme a queue off the top of my head. I would recommend Spotify without hesitation.",POSITIVE
"Spotify has all of the music, that I could ever want!",POSITIVE
"If there was a 0 star , I would have give that . This app is horrible . Trash garbage and everything . You can skip only 6 songs per hour . These limits are fricin suck",NEGATIVE

Really lovely music you can choose from any songs that you want,POSITIVE
"Great app. Perfect for everything from songs to podcasts, and it's all free!",POSITIVE
"I Gave 4 âœ¨, Because of I Can't Delete Local Storage Songs In Spotify App",NEGATIVE
"One of the most flawed apps out there, considering only the big and famous ones. I have problems that where addressed 5+ years ago. (after restart the downloaded files get deleted and internal storage is active again. Stops after 10min of playing. Restart in offline mode bricks the app. These are only the big ones, smaller ui decisions I don't even count) Are the devs even doing anything, or are they only doing artists contracts?",NEGATIVE
Great. Great experience to search a song and maintain playlist user friendly also. I think it should be India's no 1 music app.,POSITIVE
Finally the UI is more universal bewteen android and ios. FINALLY after 4 years ðŸ™„ðŸ˜†,NEGATIVE
A great range of music,POSITIVE
"Pretty good, but just no. The ""playing suggested songs"" is such a nigthmare + you can't skip much because you are limited to skips too. Just please remove ""Playing Suggested Songs"", it's not really helpful and just ruins everything.",NEGATIVE
Shuffle is not. I would like my playlists to be mixed,NEGATIVE
Worst app it always show no internet connection,NEGATIVE

I absolutely love Spotify but since the past few days i am unable to login into Spotify. I have tried everything from reinstalling the app to changing my password and try to login with email link. Please look into it.,NEGATIVE
"Great app and love it but why is it that music from some specific artists is not available like Linkin Park,Red hot chili peppers,twentyonepilots and it says ""we are working hard in bringing music to your region"". I would just like it to have all the music from all the artists. Four stars only for this reason otherwise 5.",NEGATIVE
Never had a problem .. I love this app,POSITIVE
Worst App...most of time received e mail stating that a someone have logged in to your account even after changing password...and e mail id too so where is security of data?,NEGATIVE
consistency proves to have worse functionality than ipods had 15 years ago. stop pushing podcasts on me. stop breaking simple features with bloaty bullsh*t.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is friggin awesome love it,POSITIVE
"THIS APP IS BAD. 1. I CANT REPLAY A SONG 2. I CANT PICK ANY SONG I WANT TO PLAY, PLEASE FIX UR APP.",NEGATIVE
"Hard to listen to an entire album at one time. It's shuffling between multiple album of the artist. That's what I want. I want to listen to the whole album, not shuffling between 2 or 3 different albums.",POSITIVE
"Very up to date music,also great oldies but goodies.",POSITIVE
Lately it's been pausing by itself and usually I could have it playing in the background while I take pictures and or be on social media it has not been working as well like it use to it needs to be fixed,NEGATIVE
"Spotify, after my update to Android 11, Spotify stopped working on my device. Always saying no internet access. I tried another account, same error. I'm a premium user. Why?",NEGATIVE
It would be great if offline downloads were possible :),NEGATIVE
Downloading Spotify for listen to ads ðŸ˜ðŸ¤¤ðŸ›ðŸŒšðŸ’¯,NEGATIVE
"Changing my review from 2 stars to 1. The music stops repeatedly. Its not my internet, phone, update, etc. Its spotify. Everyone should switch to YouTube music for the same price.",NEGATIVE

Everytime I play a song another song goes. I just try to listen to my favourite song and some other song comes on EVERYTIME,NEGATIVE
I've been using Spotify since 2018- and it's fantastical,POSITIVE
I hope Spotify will fix the design when it's about to upload to instagram story. The design's horrible enough to look at.,NEGATIVE
Terrible experience when using it to stream on Sonos. YouTube music plays wonderfully but Sonos takes minutes for some of the speakers to start working,NEGATIVE
"Perfect App so far, but i can't next my music after three times",NEGATIVE
Almost every song I've ever heard is here. The algorithms they use to identify your tastes are pretty amazing - I've been exposed to new music I never would have found on my own.,POSITIVE
Spotify does not stay on and stops all of a sudden in between calls ridiculous it's been going on for months now please fix this,NEGATIVE
It's an amazing music app I use it all the time and you can listen to it without wifi if you download songs/playlists. I love it so much great music quality and they basically have every song you can think of. If you have spotify free then you get maybe one or 2 ads every 30 minutes but other than that it's great! They have awesome deals for premium.,POSITIVE
When i first installed ur app..it worked fine with my bluetooth speaker! Now it dont play at all with same speaker. Its like spotify dont play at all anymore! You tube plays just fine.,POSITIVE

"Good music, not as many commercials",POSITIVE
Sound quality is awesome.,POSITIVE
App stops working inexplicably. Music is a huge part of my life. If a music service is offered it needs to be available any time. I'd rather go to apple.,NEGATIVE
"It's an amazing app to listen to music and podcasts, and I use it all the time! There are barely no adds, and it's the best free music app ever.",POSITIVE
Al music apps don't represent the artist well enough but this is my choice.,POSITIVE
It was a beautiful song and Drew was singing the ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥,POSITIVE
It's an great app for music.. I just love it...,POSITIVE
No canvas feature available in most Android phones,NEGATIVE
its a very nice app to refresh our mind by listening music .....I am using this app for 1 year but there are two thing that I don't like that firstmost - we can't downlod songs without premium and second one is adds after every 2-3 songs there is an add ....putting add is fine but a lot of add sometimes irritate us then I close the app after getted annoyed ...otherwise this is the best app as we cn use this app background also ..,POSITIVE
This new update is not good at all i can't even listen to my playlists anymore I'm going to delete this app,NEGATIVE

"It was always buggy, but in the last few months it is constantly crashing and just an unbearable experience on any device... Shame to have such a POS of an app which makes you feel like a sucker for paying premium, beware...",NEGATIVE

"Just the worst music app that I have used, ads are always popping up, I can't rewind the song I'm playing and when I tap a song to play there's just a random song playing and when I try to skip I cannot because I can only skip 6 times per HOUR, just use YouTube it's way better in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
Ok. I like everything here. EXCEPT FOR ONE BIG thing. Recommended songs. It just adds on my playlist in a random place. I just hate it. I don't wanna listen to song that I don't know!,NEGATIVE
I like this app but i think you have to improve your ad system,NEGATIVE
Customer service is appalling. I am getting charged for two accounts and have tried to enquire multiple times without success,NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
"I love listening to music on this app; it's definitely better than YouTube Music. The main reason why its better is because it actually allows you to listen to music with your device screen turned (for free), unlike YouTube Music, which requires you to pay for that feature.",POSITIVE
Its very weird i installed it and it was good now i go to my liked songs literally plays 30 secs of the song and a ton of ads doesnt even play the chourus playlist is so bad i have so many songs and i have not listened to it i dont know what happend it was good but now its really bad,NEGATIVE

thia music player is amazing... it takes care of you likes and create a play list acording it just for you this job is just done here.... I have used many music player app but I didn't found this function in those app and signing in is soo easy that you just need 2-3 mins for that and also free of cost but other music app has a complicated signing in process and caust sum amount for the downloads.... there are not dislikes that you won't find in this app... So this is my favo. music app â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,POSITIVE

I love this app. It's amazing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the removal of the loop button. I'd love the app to bring it back without us paying just for that one button which will last like 1 month or something. The app made me disappointed due to the useless removal. And if love if we wouldn't pay for the offline listening too because it's just a uselss removal (again) . The app is amazing but needs those little things back just for the sake of it. I honestly think these removals a bad.,NEGATIVE

"Pretty sound, pls give us back the preview thing when adding songs",NEGATIVE
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! You can download any music or just listen with your mobile data on the go, what else can you ask more...",NEGATIVE
Undoubtedly the best music app. I experienced bug sometimes in UI hope it will fix by next updates.,POSITIVE
Cool but ads irrititating,NEGATIVE
I'm so sorry but this new update is not it. I can't even choose a song to play I have to play my playlist on shuffle. And idk if this has always been a thing but I can't listen to my new playlist without it playing suggested songs. Also it won't let me skip more than 6 songs and hour unless I get premium. So that doesn't help when they add random songs to my playlist too. FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYHTING GO BACK PLEASE,NEGATIVE
"False advertising- ""30 minutes ad-free"" There are ads every two or three songs, so the claim at the beginning that I can listen for 30 minutes without advertising is false. I timed how long between ads-- exactly 7minutes, not your flasely claimed ""30min ad free""! This would be illegal under Australian consumer law FYI.",NEGATIVE
Excellent suggestion..... what a songs...Fall in love of it... very good as compared to wink and other apps...,POSITIVE

Best music app I love that you could go to any app while playing music,POSITIVE
This is the best app to listen music,POSITIVE
"Since the latest update my Spotify app cannot see other Spotify connect speakers, such as Sonos. Strangely, the Spotify web player can see them, so I have to open the web player on my phone to connect, and then this app can see the connected speaker. Worked fine before the update. Please fix!",NEGATIVE
It's help to ease anxiety...,POSITIVE
Very very very bad app i trail 1 day premium and download 30 song but next day song gone and not shows me my download song,NEGATIVE

all good with Spotify,POSITIVE
"Whenever I turn my phone off, the music just stops. I don't like it.",NEGATIVE
"I've only just started using it, but it's so much better than Amazon music. It has a wider range of music and it's world music library is amazing. I even found an album by my old music teacher Luis Morais from Cabo Verde. Check him out, you won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"Such an amazing app, and their support team replies to you so fast that it takes less than 2 days to solve problems regarding to your account",POSITIVE

"for an extremely popular music streaming service, it's phone app is one of the worst for sure. the app randomly closes while playing music and the ad for 30 minutes free music doesnt even work half the time. took around 2 minutes to load the first song in a playlist of mine. wonderful.",NEGATIVE
We want a new look on Spotify for all devices Like Phone iPad Laptop And PlayStation,NEGATIVE
Podcast will constantly freeze and stutter. Sometimes in the middle of listening to an episode it randomly swaps me to another episode and I lose my place on the episode I was actually listening to. App crashes quite a lot for price I'm paying. I wouldn't consider this app functional,NEGATIVE
You can listen while browsing and doing chat.. Cheers,POSITIVE
Can play anything I want including classical music. Love it.,POSITIVE
"It's amazing to use Spotify,but am not satisfied with some services because I can't download songs from Spotify.",NEGATIVE

I'm deleting this app idk if anyone else gets this problem but it's not letting me listen to my songs I can't choose my song it just plays a random one and I can't take it,NEGATIVE
Freezes on the spotify logo when the app starts & then nothing happens. Sorry for believing that spotify was a music streaming app. All I see is the spotify logo in the middle of the screen. Tried reinstalling it a few times but nothing changed. All this after being a premium customer. Couldn't have been more disappointed.Before reinstalling the app kinda worked but couldn't search for new songs bcoz apparently I never had a good internet for spotify. Meanwhile other apps work just fine. 0 stars,NEGATIVE
"It's like Pandora, but you can make your own playlist",NEGATIVE
"Since last month, this app has refused to accept my payment to premium. It's so very annoying",NEGATIVE
The update I really hate like it won't let listen the song want it :/,NEGATIVE
I wouldn't say I like it but I wouldn't also say I hate it it's just bad on my opinion because they just change it every time I just want to play a song it plays a whole different one and if I wanted to rewind it wouldn't let me and even if I add a song to my likes I can't play it if I already have a song on it just plays a part of the song so please fix this problem and thank you,NEGATIVE
"Too many ad,s but good",POSITIVE
You can access all music that you like,POSITIVE
it's alright but my problem with this app is that everytime I try to replay a song it just doesn't and if play another playlist it just gives me a recommended song so I technically wish to see this fixed,NEGATIVE
Music experience is outstanding but ads disturbance coming up so early.,NEGATIVE
Great can listen in the car,POSITIVE
At first it worked perfectly but now I cannot even log in,NEGATIVE

My favorite app. No need to look for CDs anymore. All music at my fingertips.,POSITIVE
"Great for music and podcasts, Still having issues with crashing and podcasts stop playing, this is usually after an update is conducted, using the android version on my phone. It is not that big a deal tho",NEGATIVE
My favorite app better then Pandora and YouTube music,NEGATIVE
"It's great when it works. App constantly glitches. And even with premium, my downloaded songs won't pop up unless I shut off wifi and data to get it to load. Sometimes if my phone restarts it deletes all my downloaded song and I have to redownload everything.",NEGATIVE
Best music app ever but it would be better if there is an option to sort songs by 'Artist' in my songs playlist. That too alin alphabetical order.,NEGATIVE
"It's quite frustrating to have Spotify when you're on freemium,every time I try to listen to a song sometimes ads like to cut in,in the middle of the song and completely skip over to the next song And everytime a song finishes,I'm left with a ad and another ad,done with the song,and strings if ads again,rinse and repeat",NEGATIVE
Can no longer listen/preview to the song to decide if you want to add to Playlist. And approximately after two songs they drop ads. ðŸ˜•,NEGATIVE
"Currently locked out, app says I'm not connected to the internet even though I am....so I can't really login, and I'd rather not delete the app, and redownload several gigabytes of podcasts and music.",NEGATIVE
Glitchy App; skips and pauses songs randomly. Glitches getting worse. Looking for alternatives.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is an amazing music app but it's kind of annoying that you have to use premium for more than 6? (I've forgotten how many free skips you have) although it is still an amazing app I would love to see Spotify changing the premium skips to unlimited free ones âŠ‚((ãƒ»â–½ãƒ»))âŠƒ -billie,NEGATIVE
I really love Spotify the value of this is so good and it makes me so happy,POSITIVE
Music on the go always! Love and appreciate the app!,POSITIVE
Love the variety of music. I have my calming piano music to put me to sleep at night which is so much better then the radio as no ads. I change my play list off and on my with my moods. I love country music and the 70s rock music. I found music that bring back such great memories. I would recommend this service to all. Keep up the great job. Love to be able to pick and choice my own music,POSITIVE
"Good app, but I can't log in it keeps saying no Internet connection but I do have good Internet sucks because I just paid my monthly subscription",NEGATIVE
This app is way too controlling and you don't have too much freedom in it. I understand buying premium too listen to music without data or wifi but making it so then you can't skip a song without buying premium is just dumb.,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever !,POSITIVE
Best music app i have ever tested,POSITIVE
Amazing variety and great quality audio track,POSITIVE
"This app is the best! it has all the songs you can listen to, and plus, it dosen't even give adds so its the best! for all those complainers out there saying you can get a better app to listen to music, YOUR WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! you cant. spotify is the best its even top #3 on best music.SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT, its free so you dont have to purchase anything so please read my review thank you so much! Even you spotify!!!",POSITIVE
"I love this app; I get so much music even without premium. But then again I only listen to like ten songs lol. All in all, in my personal tastes, this app is number one. Definitely better than Pandora",POSITIVE
I really really appreciate it. It's the best app for listening music with best subtitleðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥,POSITIVE
"The app posts pro-US war propaganda in something called the ""information hub"" telling me to support the US military and allies. I used to live in a refugee building with people who had families killed and homes destroyed by the US, including children. I think it's stupid for a music app to support violence and jingoism.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely loving Spotify. Lots to choose from .,POSITIVE
So good to turn off my phone to save battery 5/5 star deffently reccomend!!,NEGATIVE
Absoulutly amazing u can find any song that u r looking for and the plans r fantastic at the perfect price,POSITIVE
Great app to listen music.,POSITIVE
Great app everything seems to work as it should,POSITIVE
"Great. Pricey but very good. Almost everything you might want to listen to, filed and easily accessible. Works with sonos. Music downloadable for 30 days borrowing for mobile phone or car listening without a wifi connection.",POSITIVE
Music is flawless with spotify,POSITIVE
Needs to have an option to block certain podcasts from appearing on the main screen. I don't EVER want to see the Charles Manson-looking logo for Joe Rogan on my screen EVER AGAIN!,NEGATIVE
This app is so stupid. What's the point of letting people be able to make playlist but only aloud to listen to like 5 seconds of said song,NEGATIVE
Sometimes I have to re-download it every couple of months Other than that works fine,POSITIVE
Easy to install. Ready to listen to some good music,POSITIVE
Music app it its best. Go for it,POSITIVE
"I love Spotify,but I really don't like that their getting rid of the some good songs that I like. Like the remix of CoryxKenshin horse montage.",NEGATIVE
Horrible updater. Every time it up dates it will take hours or just freeze and not update at all cant even use it to download anything cause its stuck at 19% trying to update itself horrible app switch to stitcher,NEGATIVE
I really love Spotify it does a great job of playing my music that I like and picking other similars that are really accurately as likable as the one that they're comparing it to and I most love the fact that it does not burn down my battery is bad as other apps.,POSITIVE
I've spent over 3 hours trying to figure out how to stop shuffle play I just can't for some reason I have to listen to every song but the one I want to,NEGATIVE
I use it in my POCO phone and it's terrible. Can't listen to music without wifi,NEGATIVE
"With spotify it's not difficult to listen to music, it only gets better with the premium version because you can even listen to it offline. It helps a lot when I am stressed",POSITIVE
Why must everything need to be pay even choosable song need to pay wth,NEGATIVE
The best streaming platform,POSITIVE
Why can't I use landscape mode? Three stars until I'm able to do this. Update: its 2022 and landscape mode doesn't work if its playing interface but works in the library? Please make it be on landscape. Two stars until you give us this basic function.,NEGATIVE
Good when you have a subscription,POSITIVE
Great especially for the sleep timer,POSITIVE
"Well we all know how awesome the collection of spotify is. From independent artists to one hit wonders to artists who were great but not so popular... Old acid rock, psychedelic rock, metal, spiritual music to everything. They got greatest of collections.. For ex check out ninbus records icm for hjndustani classical music... You guys are doing great work indeed. Hire me ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜‡ðŸ™ƒ",POSITIVE
I love it but sometimes i can only go back 3 songs,NEGATIVE
"Worst experience ever. The UI is difficult, downloads dont download. I got this thinking I could put music on my phone but all I got was a headache and a monthly bill that took my like a solid 20 mins to figure out how to unsubscribe from.",NEGATIVE
When my phone doesnt freeze up i like listening to spotify,NEGATIVE
Good selection of music,POSITIVE

Made watch a 30-second ad then proceeded to tell me to stop skipping when it played recommended songs before the songs on my playlist. would not play the songs I put on my playlist. This app sucks,NEGATIVE

The functionality is not as flexible as on pc,NEGATIVE
for some reason i cant adjust the volume,NEGATIVE
"Website works phone on my phone, but app just spins and spins and never loads. Web also connects to Google cast devices, app can't figure it out. ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",NEGATIVE
This app is okay but you turn off similar songs to be played. Spotify still plays them. 1 star for lack of functionality on their part.,NEGATIVE
Apps Spotify so good download Music,POSITIVE
"As of late, Spotify has been really buggy for me. My tab S8 has issues going landscape in song where everything bunches up, it's almost impossible to swipe through songs because it thinks I'm trying to swipe down to lyrics and I just cancelled the membership and they are spamming me in the app to keep premium (I still have premium and I'm being interrupted by their ads? What the heck is up with that?!). SOO GREEDY! Not a good experience for people w/o premium (at least be a general music player)",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a perfect example of something being popular, yet mediocre. The features for the phone app compared to the computer is a joke. Basically everything is locked behind a paywall, and even if you do pay, the user interface is still a work in progress. Spotify also uses DRM, which restricts your freedom and ""ownership"" of ""downloaded songs"". I wouldn't support them for this reason alone.",NEGATIVE
The best music I love.I can't live without Spotify.,POSITIVE
Shite app very slow keeps saying I don't have an Internet connection when I do can't believe I pay for this shite,NEGATIVE
"The new update was a total trash, when I click a song it won't play it will bring me to a random playlist instead, I've only been using this app for a week so if anyone knows how to fix it please let me know, thank you.",NEGATIVE
I like being able to play music even when my phone is off,POSITIVE
"Love the app, if you can, get the year subscription and save a few bucks, fairly seamless google compatability, works great with google assistant",POSITIVE
I refuse to switch services and/or use ANY OTHER MUSIC APP. I love Spotify SO much I low-key recruit people to join the team. We're all winners here. ðŸ’šðŸ–¤,NEGATIVE
my favorite way to listen to music,POSITIVE
It was a good playing app .. now after updates it's so annoying,POSITIVE
Awesome music player but I just went to listen to my Liked Playlist and listened to 8 ads in a row. I think it could be sooooo much better if they changed to 2 ads or maybe just three every now and then. Other than that they have most of the songs I like.,NEGATIVE
make it so I can turn of shuffle it's so annoying,NEGATIVE
"Starting to feel like there are more ads than music now it seems to be getting worse (unskipple ads btw) , otherwise good app",NEGATIVE
Best music app ever!,POSITIVE
I'm kinda lazy when it comes to tech. So it def works for me.,NEGATIVE
It seems to be messing up my Bluetooth connection for other sources. I need to be be able to disable the takeover it seems to want.,NEGATIVE
Wow! Variety and not playing the same over and over.,NEGATIVE
Cause when I set a password I have to go back in a change it and it's to many advertising on this site,NEGATIVE

Best app for music selection and search. If only I could download and/or play offline ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
Great library selection.,POSITIVE
"literally flooded with ads, can't preview songs anymore which btw is the dumbest update you've given, and prices are sky high. you can't go two or three, sometimes one song without two 30 second adverts ruining your vibe and it just ruins the whole experience imo. it used to be a good app but greed took it over atp.",NEGATIVE
To many ad's that I don't use. Or know about.,NEGATIVE
Very good. I have access to any kind of music I want,POSITIVE
"This app sucks. You can only choose what you want to hear once. After that they choose for you. If you want to hear anything impoticular, go somewhere else. Again!! THIS APP IS AWFUL !!!!",NEGATIVE
It does not have unlimeted music like amazon music but their is so many ads. I can never just listen to one song but otherwise everything is good.,POSITIVE
Offline mode doesn't work all the time. Not handy when I work offshore and there's no phone signal,NEGATIVE
I love everything about it but I don't like the ads they put but overall it is great!,POSITIVE
Nice app and really appreciate the lyrics with the music ..nice thanks,POSITIVE
So many issues with the UI,NEGATIVE
The watch app is unreliable to the point of uselessness. The phone app constantly fails to connect to other devices playing music.,NEGATIVE
"You're free. When I use, I use spotify.",NEGATIVE
Why is it so hard to allow you to go down the list of songs u have on phone when u can do it on other devices. Always shuffle play,NEGATIVE
"Great app to listen to your music, all I need to say.",POSITIVE
"Spotify app and web player both randomly play 5, 10 or 30 seconds of song then move to next song. This continues through every song. App and web player automatically keep turning volume up on Android phone. Cache cleared, app Uninstaller and reinstalled, plone restarted.",NEGATIVE
Given all the different avenues that you can choose from as far as your music provider for me personally I like Spotify because it just keeps up with my interest in my different taste of music. Five stars from me,POSITIVE
It's a pretty good app but it's only three stars because instead of being ad free for 30 minutes I get an ad every two or three songs or about every ten minutes.,NEGATIVE
I tried paying for the students plan. I got verified but the payment refused to work. I tried multiple times and at this point it's just really frustrating.,NEGATIVE
I love it but the limited skipsðŸ¤­,NEGATIVE
awesome!! Spotify has never let me down!! I can find the songs other apps don't have with lyrics and more from the artists!! Love it!,POSITIVE

Can always find the best tunes on Spotify! We love it.,POSITIVE
"I hate this new update u can't take it off of shuffle and it won't let me play the songs I want to play on my Playlist like before, and it won't let me turn it off",POSITIVE
Easy to use. Found old and new favorites,POSITIVE
Great way to listen to podcasts,POSITIVE
I love this app but you cant swipe down to see the lyrics on android and i wish i could so maybe could you fix that? Thank you.,POSITIVE
The music keeps stopping and I have to unpause it it also freezes a log so I would like you to fix it please I love this app and I don't want to delete it,POSITIVE
Family membership has been paid. But I cant use my downloaded music with no internet connection. Why? Happened 4 months after having and now again 2 years later.. Cant seem to fix it myself. Please help.,NEGATIVE

"was asked to rate after just using it a few minutes - might be great, but how should i know ...... yet",NEGATIVE
I dont use wifi on my phone so this appdoes not work!,NEGATIVE
Good when it works. Has issues with Chrome cast audio. Often stops and has to be restarted. Please stop moving the shuffle option about. Still playing up after trying the suggestions.,NEGATIVE
"The app on a watch needs a lot of work. I download a podcast from my library and listen to it later, but in my downloads it shows all podcast episodes and I have to try to find the downloaded one. This is made far far worse by the fact that browsing downloads when not tethered to a phone is unforgivably slow. I often have to stop my walk and fiddle with my watch for 3-5 minutes just to start another episode. The latest update crashes all the time, which is just as well because the app becomes unusable on trying to change playlists and only a crash makes it work again. And that's only a few of the issues.",NEGATIVE
Great music. All types Commercials one or two that's ok the music makes up for it. ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ§ðŸŽšï¸ðŸŽ¼ðŸ”ŠðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŒðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½,POSITIVE

Every time I open the app there is adds more common. And it's not short adds like YouTube. You'll spend over a minute watching three adds often afters only 2 or 3 songs. Not to mention how misleading the half hour of free listening is. Told me I have 30 minutes of add free listening at 20:42 and gave me an ad at 20:45.,NEGATIVE
Been dissappointed for a long time. Queue system is garbage. I pay to use a dysfunctional app... at least put some effort into it you already do nothing :/,NEGATIVE
"Enjoying every info that is enriching and to change lives, the music too.",POSITIVE
I HATE how you only get 6 skips per hour. Nobody has time to wait that long until they can skip songs again,NEGATIVE
Too many adds with not enough selection of music. Even when you pay for the service every other day another song I like dissappears.,NEGATIVE
"Great app, but leave the politics out of it. I don't need or care for you to give me a opinion on anything. I can research and find facts for myself. Stick to bringing music and podcasts unfiltered and unregulated.",NEGATIVE

"Normally I'd give 5 stars but I can't like songs anymore, the notification for songs dosnt pop up so I can't play them outside the app anymore, and I can't skip through songs to a part I like, it pretends as if there isn't a song playing.",NEGATIVE
Best app for music bo problems,POSITIVE
Crashes often after the latest update.,NEGATIVE
Mhm guys this app is not bad but I will tell you one think that is when you use phone when you just started a song and you can't play another idk why and another if you want to play another play another song you have to buy Spotify premium that is not free And another think this type of app is so weird,NEGATIVE
"Always loved spotify but as of recently it would only play like 20 of my 3000 sum odd songs before I would have to re shuffle, I'm sure they did this for cache reasons but I'm not a big fan of it",NEGATIVE
ever since I updated the app I can't find the lyrics to any song,NEGATIVE
Very good for music lovers . You name it and then play it . Great for chilling out too .,POSITIVE
This is the best music app I've used apple music and Tully by all means Spotify is the best I hope all their podcasts can post videos soon!,POSITIVE
"I've had Spotify since 2019 and it was a GAME-CHANGER for me. It's the best app for listening to music, and works so much better with Premium, in my opinion. I absolutely love every part of this app. And you brought the snippet feature back! Thanks so much, Spotify! â­â­â­â­â­",POSITIVE
Okay let's start for me everything is fine except one thing. I'm a person without premium on Spotify but the thing that bothers me is on my playlist it randomly plays songs that isn't even on my playlist. And it's so freaking annoying because I can't even change it. I have to reset my phone was 6 billion times and it still doesn't stop putting songs on that isn't on my playlist. So please change that cuz it's really annoying.,NEGATIVE
Amazing technology and sound.,POSITIVE
Great music good definition,POSITIVE

Just simple and clear how to use it. Even for 80++,POSITIVE
I can't listen my liked songs because of too many different songs that i don't want to listen an i can't even skip them.,NEGATIVE
"The app is usually pretty good. But lately with the new updates it keeps stopping my music randomly or not opening a tab in my notifications so I can skip or pause songs without fully opening the app. I thought it was just my phone at first, but other people's reviews have shown me otherwise.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent app, outstanding music quality. I love it ðŸ˜ðŸ’•",POSITIVE
I can't pick a specific song and it will never let plus when I make a Playlist I expect the songs I added not Spotify picked ones,POSITIVE

"Completely bugged since last update! I am unable to see or play any of my playlists, shows or anything! I'll ask for a refund of my fee cause I simply cannot use the app in my android phone. So sad to see such a wonderful app being so badly managed and they simply don't correct it!",NEGATIVE
Its Always crashing after playing any audio for 5 to 10 mins.,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify â¤ï¸ ðŸ˜ Best app by a country Mile,POSITIVE

I've never had any issues with spotify!,POSITIVE
There's an issue with my phone and I absolutely CANNOT get my app icons on my screen. I've tried and still unable to open spotify even after uninstalling and reinstalling it again. It only gives me the option to uninstall the app again and the icon will not pop up. What can I do??,NEGATIVE
Does not let you pick a song and play it. Shoves it's own playlist on you.,NEGATIVE

"Easy to use lots of music, still more to discover I'm happy",POSITIVE
"is there an option to choose what podcast I listen to on my daily drive? Also your algorithm for randomizing a playlist sucks. I get the same 10 songs no matter what out of 10,000 saved like songs I only get to hear the same 20 over and over. .?. Why does Spotify choose what I listen to in my daily drive they have me listen to fashion and some journalism s*** I would never f****** listen to and I can't change it.",NEGATIVE
Used to love Spotify and pay for premium. Won't even play my music now. Only plays through two songs. No point in having it now.,NEGATIVE
Best but too ads,NEGATIVE
I adore spotify. My only problem is that it doesn't allow you to deselect explicit songs. Not so good when you're listening to a recommended playlist in the car with the kids and explicit songs come on.,NEGATIVE
The recent update put the pause button all the way to the left of the screen along with the skip back and forward button. The skip back and forward button are right next to each other and very small. How can one expect not to click the wrong button. Who thought that would be a good idea?!,NEGATIVE
Constantly interrupting my playlist with random songs is a stinker ðŸ’©,NEGATIVE
I just love finding all my favorite songs!,POSITIVE
Awesome & amazing experience.Love the app.,POSITIVE
Thank God not too many ads spoiling the good mood n music.Thank you .,POSITIVE
Chronicly unable to cope with occasional loss of internet. As if app forgets daily to download my songs. I don't want to be Spotifys network admin.,NEGATIVE

Very good service if you ever need help they will do their best as fast as they can. Easy to use and premium is worth it,POSITIVE
I pay for premium cuz I hate ads. Still get ads ... For artists... Playlists ... Etc. Super annoying. And app has been very buggy. Can't open certain playlists...

I love the premium and even the free is good.,POSITIVE
"I swear to God, why don't you guys try to help me with this goddamn app, spotify can't use wifi, why? I have tried to contact this matter but there is no response, disappointed",NEGATIVE
Spotify really needs to develop a way to show what's attempting to download. This app has been stuck at 16% download for the past two days. It's a waste of my battery and annoying to continue to look at. The app is up to date. I'm not having any problem streaming music. I'm not having any issue with any other app. My original complaint about this is from 2019 and apparently Spotify isn't that concerned.,NEGATIVE
Overall it was very good but like at least in playlists make it like premium,POSITIVE
I BEEN USING THIS APP FOR A LONG TIME AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.,POSITIVE
Spotify is a good app I enjoy listening and using it but I hate how when I'm creating an playlist with looped songs it adds random songs I don't want in there and won't let me get rid of them all,POSITIVE
"Best app ever, premium is cheap and ads aren't as bad. Free music always, you can play it even when your device is off! Did I mention that if you're in the app while watching an ad, you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening?! Soo easy to search up your favorite songs and find new ones! Playlists are easy to make to! This is truly the best app for listening to music",POSITIVE
Relentlessly nags me to give it Bluetooth access.,NEGATIVE
I adore listening to so many different things on this app l would and do recommend this to anybody xxxxxx,POSITIVE
The best music app. I get Prime Music as member but seldom use it. Spotify is so much better!,POSITIVE
Best music app if you're a paid user. Although the podcasts are trash and get recommended on the home screen that you can't remove so it's really irritating.,NEGATIVE
"I've had Spotify (premium) for about 6-7 years. I'll tell you one thing.. it doesn't really get better. My entire experience has been full of bugs and glitches. Think of a situation, and I've probably dealt with it through Spotify. To be honest, I really don't know what these ""updates"" do. They're always SO horrible, I usually can't use the app for days or weeks until they come out with a bandaid fix that kind of scoots you along in the app. It's janky at best most days.. ðŸ‘€ 4 new service..",NEGATIVE
"App always shuts down. Reinstalled numerous times. There is no support team. Frequently headed tk a place with no service, all of my ""downloaded music"" was No longer on my phone.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely amazing app. I love it. I love it. I love it.,POSITIVE
This is very very nice app I love singing and this is music This is cool ðŸ”¥ app So so so cute App ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,POSITIVE
"Love the App, the only thing I don't care for, is you can't really stop, and go back to another song. It is hard to figure out, but I'm still learning.... This app came in handy, for the CCMF , in Myrtle Beach, SC.. June 9-12, 2022... LOVE LISTENING TO MY FAVORITE ARTISTS SONGS!!!",NEGATIVE
"The app stops playing podcasts while I am driving. It re starts after a short pause. Have tried to delete and reinstall app but hasn't fix the issue. After several re starts, the app stops playing. Open the app and it looks like it closes and re opens and then re plays the podcast from the beginning.",NEGATIVE
"App is completely broken now Previously the app was fantastic but now it doesn't work at all.... Had to resort to web player... And bearing in mind im a seafarer i don't get constant internet so have to rely on the app download function.... Ive uninstalled and reinstalled oj phone and computer but nothing works! Music just refuses to play! Please fix it!!!! EDIT: the apps worse than ever. All playlists are completely ""empty"" meaning no music at all",NEGATIVE
GIVE BACK THE OPTION TO LISTEN TO A SONG BEFORE ADDING IT TO A PLAYLIST!! IT WAS A GOOD FEATURE THAT HELPED ME FIND MORE MUSIC. also for song radios try to make it so the songs in the radio actually fit the vibe of the current song we are listening to. I was listening to a dark edm sounding song then the songs in the radio where all bright and upbeat so they didn't fit the sound,POSITIVE
Why did they remove the ability to exit the app by right or left swiping the spotify player widget on the phones notification bar? At least add an X button or something so we can easily close out the app. YouTubes notification bar widget has a X button.,NEGATIVE
"It has every type of music your finding for, the best app to hear music.",POSITIVE
Its ok but it needs more songs,NEGATIVE
"Offline mode doesn't work. I have been using premium subscription for some years now and never bothered with offline mode as I would most of the time have connections. Recently, while traveling I noticed that the app had downloaded all the songs I asked, but still it will not play without internet. I had cleared the cache, deleted all data, downloaded again the files, and the problem still persist...",NEGATIVE
My favorite place to listen to music,POSITIVE
"After 2 or 3 songs, it will suddenly stop playing!",NEGATIVE

Great that it predicts the kind of music I listen to,POSITIVE
Greatest music platform yet,POSITIVE
"absolutely amazing but please get rid of the ""playing suggested song"" thing. lots of people find it irritating that they have to skip 5 songs just to listen to the song they wanted. it isn't that hard to just play the song they clicked on",NEGATIVE
"Latest updates have been causing the app to crash repeatedly, won't display currently playing song (so there are no controls), and songs keep playing even after swiping up to close the app.",NEGATIVE
Great App ever keep it up guys like this ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘,POSITIVE

The music selection is top choice,POSITIVE
Spotify gives amazing music experience. All playlists are so good and give goesbumps. I love this app,POSITIVE
"Why are you charging us for an app that doesn't open, an app that does not play a playlist you select, an app that will switch to a song's ""radio"" when an alarm ringtone is chosen from a certain album! Why would you play the album of a ringtone dummies? Why wouldn't the music that was playing prior to the selected ring for an ALARM continue to play after the alarm is snoozed? This app is f'd up and y'all have the audacity to add audiobooks?!? Typical America, won't fix it B4 going to the next.",NEGATIVE
Love the app but why can't Android have drag down gesture for player window like Ios. It's so annoying i have 6.67 inch display and i have to use 2 hands to drop the player window. Other issue I face is that application cold boot is way long like 8-10 seconds long why is it like that?,NEGATIVE
Very nice to listen9,POSITIVE
"I would like to alert the developers to a current bug in the software. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I tried curating a queue, after queueing 5 songs, the app experienced an error (no error code), and all queued songs disappeared from the queue. This happened twice in a row. I love the app and pay for premium. I would love for the app to queue as many songs as I want, as it used to, thanks. Also, discover weekly shouldn't play songs already liked or previously played in discover w",NEGATIVE
I love the app but it has like a million glitches like Not showing the name of a song or randomly pausing the music and much more but it wouldent fit in 500 characters so i think i will stop here,NEGATIVE

"I love Spotify, but I wish we could play songs without do many ads or having to use premium. But y'know do what you gotta do I guess. Great so overall!",POSITIVE
"Be perfect if their shuffle didn't suck! If I listen to a playlist with plenty songs, and on shuffle I constantly hear the same songs over and over.... And even when on shuffle it plays the same songs in the same order when reopening the app!",NEGATIVE
"This app is the worst. When I click on a song to play, it plays a different song? You need to fix your app or I will fix it for you. They should at least let us skip ads, and let me actually listen to the songs I want to and not want Spotify wants me to listen to?. L Bozo, don't download this app it gave me trust issues because I never saw what was coming next. ðŸ˜",NEGATIVE
I would like to say that this is the bestest app of songs in my life I don't know i just feel so good when i play songs in it,POSITIVE

"Unable to use with mobile data, only works on wifi.pointless.",NEGATIVE
"loved this app for the longest time, but the layout changes are vile. it's hard to navigate, the shuffle and loop buttons are far too small, the play/pause and skip are so weirdly put together it's hard to use. almost no new layout updates have been good recently and i'm questioning if it's worth paying for it anymore.",NEGATIVE
I'm unable to enjoy premium right now but when I can it's the greatest way to listen.,POSITIVE
I like the app. It has good music although it dictates what song I should listen to!! I hate,POSITIVE
Bring back enhance option in our music library.,POSITIVE

"Pretty good ngl I hate the playlists though, absolutely horrible. However this is only on mobile nothing else.",NEGATIVE
"I liked using this app over youtube, as it used to have fewer ads per hour overall and worked great for the flow of my playlists. Note, this review is only for my experience with mobil app, not for pc which is highly superior to mobil options wise. Recently i get 10 ads for every 1 song. Its an obvious push to get people to pay for premium, which is underhanded in the extreme. Even youtube gives you less ads per song and theres an ad or three on every single video. App sucks now",NEGATIVE
"If you don't have spotify premium, it can get annoying with ads, but overall worth it",POSITIVE
latest update is way too glitchy. songs completely stop out of nowhere. also the songs skip a lot or don't even play,NEGATIVE

This app is have the best music ever,POSITIVE
It amazes me that an app like this can have four stars why do I have to connect online after I download an episode why do I have to use data to see in episode that I've already downloaded that seems to me like a bunch of BS. So I'm like you know this sucks is somebody that only has two gigs of data per month. I'm just starting to hate the internet sooner or later you'll be gone and you'll be forgotten and nobody will remember you but I don't remember the hate for your data usage,NEGATIVE
The ads and skipping 6 tracks per hour is a problem for me,NEGATIVE
Pretty good although I definitely wish there were either less ads or at least they wouldn't play the exact same 3 or 4 ads every time.,POSITIVE
"Its a great app for listening to music but the software is just rather buggy and seems to enjoy not working. shuffle play repeats songs that has literally just played, adding albums/playlists to the queue breaks the app as the same album plays after selecting any song not in that playlist. I could keep going but my fingers are tired ðŸ¥±",NEGATIVE
'Go to song radio' is all changed just has random songs on it that I don't listen to,NEGATIVE

Spotify is absolutely amazing,POSITIVE
I've been using spotify premium for years and liked it but recently it simply wouldn't start very often and I have to reinstall it several times a week,NEGATIVE
"I've been thoroughly enjoying it so far. Except for the fact that no matter how much research and app searching I do, I can't find how to rearrange my playlists. It just does not work. That's the only thing that lowers this from a 4 or a 5, to a 3.",NEGATIVE
I open the app and listen to so many wonderful ads!!Amazing experience!!,POSITIVE
This app is good but witha suggestion......u can give that download option without using premium,POSITIVE
Very flitchy after a year of updates. Improve or stop charging me... Update. Still garbage glitchy and slow,NEGATIVE

"Best music app out there. Can download to my own library. Save favs, even link with other apps like Google maps. A 5 star app all day!",POSITIVE
"Video stream not working anymore, stoped working in the midle of a podcast.",NEGATIVE
Everytime I play Joe Rogan's podcast the app shuts down. It happens with nothing else in the app. Also bay area rap music could have better selection.,NEGATIVE
Fix the app because it keeps crashing lol..,NEGATIVE
The best music app by far thanks Spotify loving the app,POSITIVE
This is the shittest app i have ever used i make my own playlist can't even listen to any of my songs and all i get is recommended and i have internet fix your damn app!,NEGATIVE

Great service had some issues but all resolved now,POSITIVE
The subscrition is totally worth it also I like the year playlists as well,POSITIVE
Please stop adding songs to my playlists I can't stand half the artists you shove down my throat. I can't even block creators from showing up. I find a small playlist specifically for a band and then every indie rock artist crams their way into it.,NEGATIVE
Very impressed with Spotify really fun to use,POSITIVE
I will not give a single star to this app it is not worth it whenever you download it it stops running after few days. This is every time of this app. Sometimes it hangs. Sometimes it asks to update again and again.Now how many times should I update this app? May give this app one star because my review was not getting posted.,NEGATIVE
"Too many advertisement for every single song. At the moment i really hate this app, otherwise i love the app",NEGATIVE
AI algorithm is very biased to location and weights for play history and search history are very low.,NEGATIVE
"Some nice content, just hard to find things I like. And I frequently have to press play again when it just stops multiple times in the middle of a podcast.",NEGATIVE
"So far, this is the best music app I have came across. It has everuthing, like literally every music...",POSITIVE
I m facing problem from last week ...app stops working shows not internet connection while all other apps are working smoothly..please help me resolve this issue,NEGATIVE
Its playing songs i dont wanna listen to very annoying make it stop!Stop playing song that arent even in my liked songs.When i want to listen to a song on my liked songs THERE ARE SUGGESTED SONGS I HATE IT AND I HATE THIS APP,NEGATIVE
Love it. Just try to minimise the ads,NEGATIVE
Lyrics of many songs are not available. Overall experience is amazing but i face a simple problem that while listening to song i miss some important notifications. I want to stop playing when notifications arrive or allow notifications bell while listening.,NEGATIVE
Spotify on PC is better since there aren't as many limits on mobile as on PC.,NEGATIVE
Why'd y'all remove the enhance button in playlists?! Was the best feature.,POSITIVE
Sabse best aap for music..no add only music ðŸŽµ very happy for this aap,POSITIVE
It play's every song that i dont want to listen to.,POSITIVE
why when i put multiple songs on queue it starts playing by the last one i added instead of the first one? for the love of god change it back i have a family,NEGATIVE
this app is so good i can hear all the songs free,POSITIVE
Great other than the ads,POSITIVE
It's so good free music,POSITIVE
Need to resolve bug issues Auto pause while having good connectivity,POSITIVE
I like the playlists and listening to podcasts,POSITIVE
I give it a four because I don't like how long the adds are sometimes and I don't like that I can't pick my music when I run out of premium,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify! The music selection is a music ðŸ’• dream. When Spotify put The Faragher Brother on it's stream I was thrilled. With that being said other streaming app have music I enjoy that can't be streamed on Spotify. I have discovered music mentioned in films because Spotify name was linked to the song. I enjoy how Spotify pay attention to my listening pattern and build excellent playlist for me.,POSITIVE
"Used to work, but now it keeps stopping and closing if I go to apps",POSITIVE
Best musical app i have ever seen,POSITIVE
Struggles at times to connect to other apps.,NEGATIVE
Spotify needs to improve a lot of bugs for Android users. Constant listening to songs you didn't even select. Cannot repeat a song when ever you want. Etc.,NEGATIVE
Amazing and easy to use!,POSITIVE
i like this app there is all songs !!!!,POSITIVE
"The app is easy to use and there's a bunch of different music, not just the popular ones. There are good podcasts and stories, too. The reason I'm rating a 3 is maily for the glitching. The app will shut down or stop playing music for no apparent reason. This happens on my iPhone and laptop. Also, the ads are too much. For the most part I'm fine with them, until there's 4 or 5 of them in a row. It just gets annoying. One or two would be good.",NEGATIVE
I dislike how shuffling the playlist always resumes the last played song that was shuffled instead of shuffling the playlist entirely,NEGATIVE
Unable to add multiple songs to queue while listening to songs from search. For an app like Spotify to miss a feature so basic is just insane. Please fix.,NEGATIVE
"This app is a great platform for listening your favourite music. As I'm a BTS army this app is so good for me. It gave me perfect blend for me + BTS. I loved this app. No for only k-pop it's a great app for bollywood, Hollywood,punjabi and many other language songs. Thanks Spotify for this amazing facilities. And I hope you'll improve it more ( it's already a great app)...",POSITIVE
"It's all good but , when we watch ads it say say that "" You will get 30 min of uninterrupted music "" but after 4-5 min the ad will start again ..... Fix this problem as soon as possible Otherwise All thing is good",NEGATIVE
Great app but ads are annoying,NEGATIVE
enjoying the discounted premium access... love this app...paid for it for years ... really nice to be able to order the playlist the way i want it... great app...great music ðŸŽ¶,POSITIVE
Its very nice i listen daily but it needs free download its a only problem otherwise its good.,NEGATIVE
I think this app named spotify should get 5 star rating from every one,NEGATIVE
A very commendable app for music,POSITIVE
Easy to navigate app. They have had every song I looked up.,POSITIVE
"Apps been really buggy lately. Tried deleting the app and re-installing it but nothing changed. Good app just needs the new bugs fixed. UPDATE: A year later and the problem is still unresolved. I've noticed that the ""glitches"" only occur when I'm listening to anti-establishment podcast and alternative news sources. No problem just listening to music. I wonder if anyone else has the same problem.",NEGATIVE
Very good app but needs premium to get rid of ads,NEGATIVE
"PLEASE remove the ""we added these songs to your playlist"" feature, it's absolutely annoying. I want to play some songs on my playlist then suddenly a song im unfamilliar with comes in, like I only wanted to listen to songs in my playlist, not some random sings that I have never even heard of.",NEGATIVE
So many ads..........at a time,NEGATIVE
"I used to like Spotify but the shuffle mode I don't like and I used to have it repeat but now I can't, I like the older version so I'll give it a 2 star",NEGATIVE
If I could I would give it a zero it will add songs that you didn't put on your Playlist and you can't take it off,NEGATIVE
"I like this app.â£â£â£ Because when you play any song and if you don't have much net data , like if your data is totally over 100 % over still that song is playing without any internet Spotify don't need to take much more net . So yaah , I am obsessed with this",NEGATIVE
Need to add more songs in que but the best best best thing is which is unique about this app that there is no any interruptions advertisement free app keep going on guys like this awesome. We hope will not facing the ads interruptions in this app in future,POSITIVE
It is very annoying that the ad pop up after each song. I have been using this for a while but recently it is been very disappointing.the ad is showing after each and every song i played. Hope you consider this and fix the problem ðŸ™‚,NEGATIVE
The best app for listening BTS songs,POSITIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
Best app for the songs,POSITIVE
Good app for listening songs ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ Thank you ðŸ™ðŸ™â¤ðŸŒ¹â¤ðŸŒ¹,POSITIVE
The best app. I love the Spotify.,POSITIVE
"I already paid for my Spotify premium, but where's my premium? Give me back my money!!",NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify. The music and the podcasts are great. If you can't find something to listen to on it, I don't know what to tell you.",POSITIVE
Very very buggy and the UI can be so much better. Give podcasts its own space in the library,NEGATIVE
Everything was perfect until my last update can't even play a single music or play the songs I've searched for,NEGATIVE
One of the best music app But auto recommendation doesn't work fine And many bugs are there to be fixed It wont work on wifi it shows no internet connection even if the wifi is turned on. Doesn't make sense ðŸ¤¦ðŸ˜‚,NEGATIVE
"Spotify should change its name from spotify to adstify, very good platform for listening to ads.",NEGATIVE
Can find varieties/category songs as we need,POSITIVE
This is a good app but it will be more better if we can download songs for free,POSITIVE
It's a great app and definitely a good way to get into a good mood the only reason it's not a 5 is because of the adds after songs,POSITIVE
"I think it's a whole load of BS, that when you pay for premium you still have to listen to the stupid commercials and ads. But if you pay for extra extra special premium you don't have to hear ads anymore that's total BS!",NEGATIVE
All collection of songs are available.. happy to use this app,POSITIVE
"Often lose the play bar and app has been problematic on my Android recently, have had to reinstall a few times",NEGATIVE
Overall it wasn't bad until it started mixing up my songs. Mr beast song was chug jug with you jealousy jealousy was brutal. It was confusing. Four months later and it still playing the wrong songs.,NEGATIVE
Why does Spotify not treat metered WiFi connections like mobile data? It shouldn't refresh downloaded songs upon connecting to a metered WiFi connection like it does. Please stop chewing through my data. Why does the media player notification come back every time I lock the phone? If I dismiss the notification that means I'm done and you're now bugging me tokeep playing.,NEGATIVE
I want to have free music please if you can consideration for my ratings,NEGATIVE
Most of the Red hot chili pepper songs are not there !,NEGATIVE
"Great music, good app",POSITIVE
It. Has. The. Songs. And. Playlists. I. Love.,POSITIVE
Without premium you cannot do many basic things and it's very restrictive on what you can or cannot listen to for you can't just look up a song and listen to it without waiting or using your limited skips to find it that doesn't help find new creators because they allways play songs I already have heard,NEGATIVE
"4 stars because it's good but I don't have any money to buy premium, so I can give really a good rate as 5 stars",NEGATIVE
"I went to play one song, and multiple somgs played. Most of them were not by the artist I was looking for. I went to skip to the song and ran out of skips. The song I wanted wasn't played. Almost deleted the app Edit: I should be able to turn of the setting.",NEGATIVE
Worst paid app ever. Cant even login properly. Songs stop playing at random times. Email links expires every 3 seconds. Waste of storage,NEGATIVE
I live on Spotify. Everyday. All day. It would be a long day without it.,NEGATIVE
"One thing i feel good about this is supporting actual artists instead of just downloading mp3 music from internet. I dont know is that satisfaction worth my money. But still i will continue to use spotify premium. (Had got premium for some trial offer which lasts for 3 months which i have planned to continue). However, for free users, your taunting ads are really bad. Everyone knows it is intentional and improve yourself and have some respect.",NEGATIVE
Very informative helpful podcast.,POSITIVE
"Seems as though when you type in an artist they only play that artist main stream music. That's fine an all but I'd also like to hear some of their music that never made the radio/billboards. Also, when I type in that artist I'd also like to hear other artist like them and artist from that Era. I don't care to hear that one artist the entire time until I change the station.",POSITIVE
Ads too much,NEGATIVE
Excellent range of information and support.,POSITIVE
Most of the time the app is not conneting. It says internet not available,NEGATIVE
"Use to be my go to app, and I was a long time premium user. However over the past 2 years they've clearly been unable to handle technical issues, with some users completely unable to use the service for weeks or months at a time. They sooner or later fixed it, but never publicly announced the issue and swept it under the rug. I was one of those users. And now, I've been unable to download songs again for a while now. I'm not paying 10 dollars monthly for no ads,and I'm tired of the bad service.",NEGATIVE
I love my Spotify.....the only only thing that really truly bothers me is when I want to repeat a song it doesn't....it goes on to the next song. I at several times was gonna delete the app...and download another music app....but just decided not to. I'd give this a 5 star rate if it would to repeats on songs but 4 is still ok to good.,POSITIVE
"gives you upwards of 4 ads, each 30 seconds long, all unskippable, either every time you skip a song, or just after every few songs. it is disproportionate how many ads you get for the amount of music you get to actually listen to. i become more infuriated by this app every time i use it. it should be illegal to push this amount of ads in an attempt to force people to buy your garbage premium service just to avoid the onslaught of ads. disgusting",NEGATIVE
It's great apart from the triple ads.,POSITIVE
The volume for the songs suddenly lowers on its own. The amount of ads and the notification suddenly goes away and it stops playing.,NEGATIVE
Uninstalled. Can't stop the app from spontaneously opening and playing some of the worst music imaginable.,NEGATIVE
Fix your app I'm trying to play a goddamn playlist but oh the playlist doesn't actually want to play songs that are on the playlist.,NEGATIVE
It's ok. I hate how I have to get premium to have infinite skips and no ads. Ads I can live with. But getting it like two or three songs later is really annoying,NEGATIVE
Good app but the ads make me wanna shove a 69 foot pole down my ear.,NEGATIVE
It's forever saying offline when I'm not. So painful,POSITIVE
"Spotify started inserting ads into podcasts, even for premium members.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is one of the best app in which we can listen all type of songs,POSITIVE
Hey Spotify please make option where users can choose multiple song all at once to add to some list.. it'll be easier PLEASE,NEGATIVE
My liked songs on my premium account keep disappearing. I have to reinstall more than once a week to keep it working. Thumbs down. ðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Often have to restart app several times to get music to play or playlists to load. Very frustrating.,NEGATIVE
You can't play 2 songs in a row without getting a ad without premium,NEGATIVE
Good music well organized.,POSITIVE
Spotify always puts music that I don't like and never played my favorite song,POSITIVE
"The app was fine then suddenly today my playlists and downloaded music are gone. The app just does not function. I cannot play any music. I see my account is attached and it has all my information, just not the the 1 thing I want from the app, music.",NEGATIVE
"Excellent, high quality music and huge collection's of music. I love it!",POSITIVE
"*amended* You brought back the previews!! And the bugs were temporary Lately had trouble with songs not playing, or have to skip 3 songs ahead for it to begin and even then it stops part way through a track. My internet connection has no issue and now without being able to preview tracks when adding songs to playlists or generally trying to find new music this is just another music app. I might as well use the free version as the features now offered are average. Please bring back the previews.",NEGATIVE
"It's just nice to listen to music and not have it turn off when you ex out, but you have to pay for no adds which absolutely sucks ðŸ˜” therefore I m taking of 1 star",NEGATIVE
Absolutely love spotify!,POSITIVE
Great selection of 50-80's rock and country.,POSITIVE
Great music listening app.,POSITIVE
"Vast Options: Music, Albums, Artists..Well-Done!!ðŸ‘Œ",POSITIVE

The Best Music App. if all time. member since08,POSITIVE
It's a great app but it doesn't work without WiFi or it doesn't work fast but it'll get 5 stars â­â­â­â­â­ but I think it needs to work without WiFi bc I do like apps that work without WiFi/Games without WiFi anyways that's my report if it doesn't update I'm deleting it I really I'm not trying to be mean to the person who made it but this really is needing to be updated for real (â–€Ì¿Ä¹Ì¯â–€Ì¿ Ì¿)á¶ áµ’Ê³ Ê³áµ‰áµƒË¡ kk byee,NEGATIVE
awesome ðŸ‘I love that I have daily mix songs for my taste.,POSITIVE
I like the way u can program music and wake up to it,POSITIVE
"I loved Spotify until the most recent update. Now it's just becoming pay to listen. You can't skip through more then about 5 songs without premium and you can't choose a specific song to listen too. I'm super pissed at this update and I'm sure others are to, please fix this it's really angering me.",NEGATIVE
"I love it,I get to listen to all my favorite music",POSITIVE
I loved this station station since I first had it,POSITIVE
"Frequent updates still haven't fixed my most common problems. Now, whenever I connect to something via Bluetooth it automatically deletes my queue. Why?",NEGATIVE
Good selection of music and playlists but music will randomly stop playing despite having loop music on. ***edit June 2022***-> still an issue a year later,NEGATIVE
Alarm on Google still not working,NEGATIVE
"Instant music is pretty nice. Like how it gets to know my taste, but daily mixes are very repetitive",NEGATIVE
"Offline music is terrible doesn't seem to play until I have service. What is the point of this..? Too many negatives with this app, don't even get me started. Apple Music is getting better day by day but offline is needed. I'm off the grid more than you would like or know!",NEGATIVE
This app is trash I tried to log in it didn't let,NEGATIVE
When i want play a song i find a different song playing,NEGATIVE
It's not letting me listen to music please tell me I don't have to get the premium just to listen to music,NEGATIVE
"Read some of the reviews while I was downloading the app and straight away I thought great, why did I update the old app. They should change their name to ADDIFY well I thought it was funny.",POSITIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
This app keeps skipping and play songs when it pleases. I uninstalled at least 3 times. Worked for a few minutes then started messing up again.,NEGATIVE
"I have waited through several updates to get on here and complain because I figured they would have fixed this by now, but the only reason I use Spotify is for podcast and almost every time I'm streaming a podcast the app will jump to the end of the podcast within about 10 minutes of having started it. Then I have to find where I was, usually causing me to have to pull over. This has gotten absolutely ridiculous",NEGATIVE
It's more honestly to tell the user please purchase this apps at the beginning. Both side happy,POSITIVE
"WORST MUSIC APP EVER. You can't even play an actual song without ten million ads and premium stuff being shoved in your face. Spotify seriously needs to go out of business or something cause you can't even listen to music. I'm sorry if I'm overreacting but my god JUST LET ME LISTEN TO MUSIC!! WORST ""MUSIC"" APP EVER!!!! I AM PROBABLY DELETING MY SPOTIFY ACCOUNT!!",NEGATIVE
Spotify is the best app where u can listen ðŸŽ¶ to music,POSITIVE
"Top quality massive variety of music , even rare stuff",POSITIVE
It's a good app it's just doing too may extra stuff when I just want to listen to one singular song... Annoying asf,POSITIVE
Lots of options when it comes to artists and albums. I also appreciate the fact that I can access all this great music for free. The audio(output) though is not that great hence the 4 stars instead of 5.,NEGATIVE
"I love the content and accessibility! It bugs me that not all (even we'll known multi-platinum selling) artists music are featured here. I get it, I'm sure it's a business thing. I also wish they did more to source underground/ up and coming content. I hate the fact that I cannot download music or instrumentals not even samples from the base platform. If so I cannot see an easy way to do it. A button would be nice also an off button. Why is it I have to close the entire app just to shut it off?",NEGATIVE
"Ads on premium. Endless podcast spam. Rate 1 star, still get front page ads for a podcast i tried once, over 6 months ago.",NEGATIVE
I love every playlist i choose....all the music i wanted to hear was there...,POSITIVE
Great app and not to expensive for all the music with no interruption,POSITIVE
"If we're talking about the phone app, it's a bummer. It's hard to use and most of the times it doesn't even play the songs I chose to play. I don't hate Spotify itself, because the application in my laptop works perfectly fine. I just wished it was easier to manage.",NEGATIVE
"Has anyone else have this app just start playing random songs thru the media player all by itself, even when not on the app? This has just recently started happening even when I'm watching youtube (music all of a sudden starts playing). Is this some new bug? FYI: this only started happening after we cancelled our premium subscription.",NEGATIVE
"I've never had many complications with this app! It has too many functions to count, and almost has everything I search for",NEGATIVE
It's the best app ever saved me when I was at my lowest.. and am so gratis...,POSITIVE
"Ads every 5 minutes even after their ""30 minutes for free"" claim.",NEGATIVE
"I'm very new to internet music, but Spotify made it very easy to get a Playlist and use it on my new car. Also, over 70 so it had to be simple!!!",NEGATIVE
It's great and really Easy to use xx,POSITIVE
Has most music. Needs better genre and artist sorting/viewing. Best music app tho.,NEGATIVE
"Was loving the user experience until they updated the UI. I know it seems like a pretty thing to be annoyed about. Theyve put the buttons closer together and left empty spaces on the playback page making it really easy to what you want to hit. Also, would love it if they could add an undo button in case you accidentally remove a song from your liked songs playlist (which is really easy to do)",NEGATIVE
The app is really good however free accounts have quite a lot of issues. For example it once played 15 (yes I counted them) suggested songs in a row before it continued with my playlist's songs and I could only skip only 6 of those,NEGATIVE
I like songs that I've listened to and songs I haven't listened to yet,POSITIVE
Too many glitches for a paid subscription app and ads on podcasts (spotify ads not the podcasters) even with premium. But when it is working its the best app for quality music downloads ive found.,NEGATIVE
Crashes when I try to play any podcast but plays music tracks just fine. Very weird. Just started happening today 6/10/22,POSITIVE
"The music is lovely i enjoy it it helps me with stress and to get outta my comfort zone , honestly it would've been a five solid ,however that changed as of yesterday , yesterday Spotify worked perfectly no issues and now I cant log into my account i used the same email that this is under but it still didn't work and i really am upset about it and have been trying to fix it but nothing is working.",NEGATIVE
"Just love the app, Spotify is literally the best for streaming music, even before I started paying premium it was just a wonderful app and I had to pay the premium as an appreciation",POSITIVE
"Good , but it will be better if i can chose music i want on a phone",NEGATIVE
I like Spotify but sometimes it plays so many adverts,NEGATIVE
"The BEST music streaming service EVER!!! I use it every single day, and don't know what I'd do without Spotify.",POSITIVE
j'adore. but like can you just let us see the lyrics on all songs & less ads please ðŸ™,NEGATIVE
My favorite music streaming platform there is all the songs you could ever want on it,POSITIVE
"Every time I try to play a song it ends up playing another song from the playlist and it really irritates me because it takes forever to find the actual song that I wanted to play, can you please fix that ðŸ˜­",NEGATIVE
I can't download music and offline mode works bad,NEGATIVE
Always can rely on a great tune to be available,POSITIVE
The app is always having issues and has to force stop all the time,NEGATIVE
Good on any device except for mobile. It doesn't play any songs and when I got the support page to help they ended up saying to just use a new device.,NEGATIVE
Awesome songs..lots of variety,POSITIVE
Great app for enjoying personal music,POSITIVE
Hey can you erase that for me can you erase that for me let me start over day for me and I'm just going to keep thinking the best and I'm going to get that check and that's just facts and then I'm going to help and do it the right way it's just facts slippers don't count so by using this app it takes me away for the song and that's the best songs,POSITIVE
Easy to use. Great content.,POSITIVE
5 Star review Good app although I hate how you have to pay premium to choose the mucic you want to listen to.,POSITIVE
Upgraded to premium for the purpose of listening to podcasts in a group with my wife while at work and you have to send the invite for her to join the group like 10 times before it finally works. Pauses and skips a lot. Sometimes it will go back a few seconds or more and repeat things. Not impressed at all.,NEGATIVE
Excellent songsðŸ‘ Hilarious!ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
"Memories and happiness in one basket, thank you",POSITIVE
Best app for music there is.!,POSITIVE
"Love it, I have it on the TV, portal & my phone! ðŸ‘ðŸ»",POSITIVE
More commercials than songs just to pissou off.,NEGATIVE
"I use the free service. It is the best free audio platform available, bar none. Love it! Great job Spotify!",POSITIVE
"I've been a premium subscriber since 2020 and the app was amazing until the last update. What happened to the ""preview song"" feature?? It used to be so convenient, clicking the side of the song that I've searched to hear a bit out of it, now I need to guess if the piece that I want to add to my playlist is the one I wanted or go to YouTube to be sure, please bring it back",NEGATIVE
Extremely easy to use.,POSITIVE
They put ads in it and you also cannot pick the song you want you have to shuffle it up or search it up so I do not like Spotify no more Spotify used to be the most funnest thing so I can play all the songs but now you have to search it up Spotify is the most worst thing there is,NEGATIVE
Issue: Not able to to view lyrics for any song.. Device: Redmi 6 Same issue happening in mi 11 lite NE,NEGATIVE
It's a great app the music quality is great even without premium and there are barely any ads. I just don't like that when an ad pops up in a different app it pauses,NEGATIVE
Simply the most excellent app!,POSITIVE
"App force closes constantly, new bugs pop up every week. For how big this app is it shouldn't have so many issues",NEGATIVE
"Artist radio feature is so broken, i d not believe it. Only a handful gets played over an over and if I click on a different song, app just doesn't recognise it. Holy moses. This is an app for music but could not play the song on a list its created.... Bruhhhhhhhhhh..... tell you ceo, he should hope 100bn from podcasts for sure as songs aren't playing.....",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is probably the best music streaming app out there, but there's just one problem. When you say 30 minutes of free listening, does it mean 30 minutes with or without an ad? I get you guys are about monetization and are probably greedy for people's money but do that honestly. Other than that I have no complaints. It's just that a silly ad pops up during my ""30 minutes of free listening."" Fixing means they're 5 stars in my book.",NEGATIVE
Great job and I would love to see more functionality for use in my Tesla!,POSITIVE
Its a good app I love it and idk why people are complaining about the ads,POSITIVE
"Payment plan is a big headache. It's supposed to debit my card monthly but doesn't and when I try to update payments it still won't work. I have tried everything the Spotify community suggested but nothing is working. Worse, all songs in my playlists only play preview.",NEGATIVE
Now playing bar keeps disappearing at random. Requires me to force stop and reopen app,NEGATIVE
The best new music algorithm out there!,POSITIVE
I will go on it a get I song I dont know or dont like and it will say have use all my skips but haven't use it in age ok so me from 3 month later I have not use this a in about 2 months and still says I have no skips,POSITIVE
"Suck app . Don't Tell me what to listen . I'll listen whatever i want fk app stupid . I can't even choose the song i want to listen . When , i was emotional it totally suck . I so mad at this stupid appp!!!!!",NEGATIVE
I Love the play lists that you offer.lots of adds,POSITIVE
"They will often ""upgrade"" you to more expensive plans without notice and to make it better, returning to your original plan is difficult and time consuming. Stolen money is not returned.",NEGATIVE
Works well with my Heos Wifi speaker. Loving Spotify. Edit. Although I now am really annoyed by the app. I want to play albums in order. Apparently you can't do that. ABSOLUTELY STUPID.,NEGATIVE
Why y'all adding some random trash songs into my playlists?,NEGATIVE
"Super good sound, great songs, not that many adds, its a amazing app",POSITIVE
Good except when it randomly stops Multiple times per minute.,POSITIVE
I had it for two days ..... The app froze twice .... And in the last day it just ate my battery even when the app was closed .... Whent from 100 % to 5 % in 3 hours with no screen time... I only use the app for like 30mins ..... Uninstalled it and the phone is back to normal,NEGATIVE

I love these app very much good audio quality thank you play store and Spotify ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
i love how spotify gave me a three month free trial i really apricated it,NEGATIVE
This app is fantastic all the music is free.,POSITIVE
I've used Spotify for a long time and it's never failed to remain consistent. It's also been extremely quick to notify me when my favorite artists and bands have new music releasing.,POSITIVE
Every good for anyone that likes music,POSITIVE
Great app it has Metallica and Pantera and all sorts of great band's,POSITIVE
Awsome app love that I can get a variety of music that matches my mood,POSITIVE

"Now playing bar disappears often, Bluetooth connectivity with my vehicle doesn't relay or update current song/podcast playing. Had no issues whatsoever with previous phone(LG G6)",NEGATIVE
"Hiding a song in release radar doesn't auto skip to the next track. When you skip manually, the app skips 2 songs ahead. Super dumb and annoying.",NEGATIVE
Always plays repeatitive songs...it seems Spotify don't wants to put effort in playing new songs..and because of this I hate some of the most beautiful songs due to repeated play,NEGATIVE
"WHY THE HECK CANT I CONNECT IT TO MY ALEXA. ""premium users only"" IF WASN'T LIKE THAT YESTERDAY.",NEGATIVE
It's really nice to use the app. Best app for song n music addictors BUT one huge negative in this app is ad experience it's totally made me cruel to hear the ad while hearing songs....à² ï¸µà² ,NEGATIVE
It's a good app for music but due to ads i don't like it,NEGATIVE
"Hate it... Hate the suggested songs Whats the use of a playlist when you,they add they're own music. I dont wanna hear your random azz song mid workout.. uninstalles",NEGATIVE

Excellent song variety and I like that spotify follows what I listen to and do playlist with those songs in it.,POSITIVE

It's an amazing app and I love it. Definitely recommend,POSITIVE
"Does not skip, easy access to your library",POSITIVE
This the best app among all but they give more adds but surely this the best platform for listening songs I just luv it. Voice quality best they know what you loved to listen ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ and must say that if you have to choose definitely pick Spotify â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Tooo many ads that disturbs you and then their add be like go premium so adds won't disturb... I am like???? ðŸ˜‘ if you could stop your premium promotion every 20 sec that would already solved the problem,NEGATIVE
Im not gonna use the app if I click on songs and it's just a preview especially if I liked the song already and not being able to rewind a song or play a song next without premium is pretty outrageous too don't recommend,NEGATIVE
"I'm not sure what is going on with reliability lately - if it's the app or Android OS but Spotify freezes, pauses constantly. Very frustrating, especially after cache clearing and restarting my phone. This should be sorted before too long. I know a good number of other people having these issues aswell. Ill have to cancel my subscription if these issues persist. Brand new phone so it can't be the hardware. * Seems like now Spotify won't share links either?",NEGATIVE
It's very slick but i want to let uh know that IN the playlist we don't get any option to customize the song's sequence the problem is the default sequence which automatically organizes them as per the uh choose them but we're not able to toggle them as per. Our. Requirements. It's very very complicated to do this initially while. Creating. A playlist. Manually....so please look forward into it like YouTube you're able toh arrange the sequence. into the playlist please. Drop these small feature,NEGATIVE
"Good app generally, but can't reorganize songs in a Playlist. Has good music, but not some of the YouTube music that we like...cocomelon and some English versions by spanish artists.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is good there's no issue but when I start the app u show us a long ad and than told us to enjoy the next 30 mins of uninterrupted music but I just came to Spotify to search the song and save it to play it later I don't want to listen the song for the next 30 mins so what's the meaning of the ad ? Why do I have to watch it u have to put the ad in between the period if someone is listening the music on Spotify for more than 10 mins that will be good for u and the consumers otherwis it's 5â­,NEGATIVE

"The ""songs for right now"" playlists are amazing!! Please keep these forever",POSITIVE
"Very unpolished. Use it on my 40mm watch 4 classic and it crashes constantly, has difficulty streaming to my BT buds and takes ~4 tries each time, dumps my downloaded songs on the regular and fights with my galaxy phone app. Very frustrating to use and this + the samsung fitness app are the only reasons why I have the watch. Very unhappy, please do something about this hot trash.",NEGATIVE
"Can updates not change the storage space back to internal storage instead of SD card please. + the app ""isn't responding"" everytime I try to open it now. Great update.",NEGATIVE
"This app is great, every so often you get an ad but usually it's just one for 30 of straight music.",NEGATIVE
Too many ads,NEGATIVE
Fantastic. Everyone said it was the best. Spotify delivers!,POSITIVE
"Love the variety of music and the ability to create playlists with music i like. Don't really mind the ads (since i use the free version), but there are too many covid ads and ads for music that just plain sucks.",NEGATIVE
App doesn't work with latest Android Update Won't show or play media doesn't show songs Un- and reinstalled app with no effect Update: last Update fixed the issue :) Except a few missing features like selection of multiple songs to add to a playlist the app is miles ahead of the competition,NEGATIVE
I get ads very two songs it's so annoying,NEGATIVE
"Nice app I'll give 5 star because you get all the songs,music in one app so no need to download any song or music liked this app a much.good job ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"Context, Content and Quality is Very Good!",POSITIVE
"Super glitchy and frustrating I ended up cancelling my subscription and deleting the app. It never works properly anymore and I can't use it most of the time. It constantly states that it's not connected to the internet even though it is. I've tried all the ""tips"" to fix it and it still doesn't work. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but now it won't even let me log in. This app is absolutely horrible.",NEGATIVE
App is not opening while connected to a wifi network but working on mobile data I can't download songs on wifi due to this reason ple look into it ASAP,NEGATIVE
This app was ok at first but my debit card was recently charged without my consent as I cancelled my account last year. This is absolute fraud!!! Do not get spotify!! They take money out of your account illegally!!! They even admitted that my account was cancelled and refused to return my money back!!! Unacceptable!!,NEGATIVE
Too much ads and cant play next song,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is an excellent app, it's easy to use and pretty straightforward. The one thing I wish Spotify did was allow you to play locally saved music as well as upload your own library of music. It's a shame I have to have 2 separate apps for music, Spotify to stream my favorites and YT music to listen to my library of music that's not available on Spotify (mixtapes, certain EPs excetera) hopefully in the future that'll change",POSITIVE
I don't like this I avoid it but spotify lite likes me I can avoid it,NEGATIVE

It includes every kind of music and lyrics Thank you Spotify,POSITIVE
It's really annoying to be listening on my Xbox or computer and the app decides to open itself on my phone and I have to constantly close it. Who thought that was a good idea? If I want to control it from my phone I WILL OPEN THE APP.,NEGATIVE
Have a great time looking at all the selections,POSITIVE
Wonderful to have so much great music at your fingertips. An excellent service.,POSITIVE
"Even with premium it's not that good. Yes, it's easy to find songs, but the other aspects don't work. When I turn my phone off or leave to app, the music will pause 30 seconds in. It won't play music without wifi. The only thing that differentiates it from Spotify without premium is that you don't get ads. Without premium, you spend more time listening to ads than you do listening music. So yeah, even with premium, it's not that great.",NEGATIVE
These guys are awful. There app is okay at its best but they want a subscription and basically force it. Only aloud to skip 6 songs? Got to listen to ads after every 3 songs? I can't even chose a specific song from my playlists? Spotify used to be a brilliant user friendly app now it's rediculous. I actually used to be a subscriber now you have gone greedy the Spotify mod is the way forward ðŸ‘ Ps. Google spotify mod apk.. :) done.,NEGATIVE
As of latley its started to buffer ever time I've locked my phone to do something and listen to music. But its every time I'm on a locked screen or as soon as I turn my screen off that it stops my music. Never used to do this .,NEGATIVE
I am in love with Spotify as I can hear any type of song any time anywhere... First of all I am a BTS ARMYðŸ’Ÿand Spotify help me a lot to listen to their music ðŸŽ¼ anytime I want.

I love ðŸ’œ you Spotify.,POSITIVE
"Spotify is not like some other apps, if you have a good connection your music will play very good.",POSITIVE
It's previous update update was better. Now when I play a song it doesn't play the full song. The song starts from the middle and plays for few seconds,NEGATIVE
Easy to use.Good music too,POSITIVE
"As premium subscriber, It is extremely annoying to get ads on Spotify-produced podcasts such as Whistleblower. Customer service said that ""the ads amidst content structure is a model proven to work for podcast creators"". What a load of bs! This is no Patreon supported creator, neither is the production particularly original. The voice is almost robotic. I'm getting very, very close to cancelling. No offer to make the customer happy, nothing.",NEGATIVE
"Your app is stupid. I can't even replay a song, and I have to listen to the song once. Do better.",NEGATIVE
"Great, just don't i can't download the music otherwise no complains",NEGATIVE
Thank you for reducing the adsðŸ’•,POSITIVE
"Idk why y'all decided to delete my review. Funny how the Bluetooth still won't connect and glitches and randomly pauses though. Very, very funny. Edit: not even a hour later and it's saying I don't internet when I clearly do",NEGATIVE
I love Spotify don't know what I would do without it,POSITIVE
"Best app for music that money can buy, I use it everyday!",POSITIVE
Adverts are a real nuisance:-(,NEGATIVE

I love that I am able to find so many of the songs I grew up on!,POSITIVE
The login experience of the app on Android is very poor. I have been trying to log in to the app since the last 30 minutes. It keeps getting times out. Faced the same issue last time and ended up creating a mew account,NEGATIVE
"very good, only problem i have with it is that i haven't been able to find a few songs",NEGATIVE
"I recommend people to use Spotify,,,,is lit",POSITIVE
"Never easier to have my favorite music in one place and quickly accessible. Let alone new hits, podcasts and...",NEGATIVE
"The service is easy to use. The UI is simple, yet elegant, responsive and easy to navigate.",POSITIVE
"Won't let me click on songs without a stupid ad, I tried it cause someone recommended it I used to like the app now it's just a disgrace. Hate the new way of things",NEGATIVE
"The constant reminder that I'm to poor to ""give the gift of Spotify"" every time I open the app is excessively annoying. I've already said no. Leave me alone.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is a great music steaming service the only thing I dont't like are the ads but they have to make money somehow,NEGATIVE
Very easy to use and works well.,POSITIVE
Enjoyed it more before they had podcasts. Now all they're pushing podcast recommendations more than music.,POSITIVE
"Works well for the most part, I have to uninstall and reinstall from time to time due to the fact that the app stops working normally.",NEGATIVE
Spotify is amazing. I use it to listen to all my music. There is occasionally an add of only 30 seconds every 1 and a half hour so not bad!! Over all really great app,POSITIVE
Stupid app that adds songs you didn't want to your playlists and when you ADD OR REMOVE ANY OF YOUR SONGS THEY ADD EVEN MORE HOLY GOD THE PERSON THAT MADE THAT SHOULD BE FIRED,NEGATIVE
Why can't I shuffle through my own Playlists now??,NEGATIVE
App plays any song EXCEPT the one selected to play. This is useless; the PC and web versions are much better.,NEGATIVE
Why does this App play random songs when all I want is my liked songs? The arrogance is staggering. Terrible user interface. Three button taps just to repeat the current song?,NEGATIVE
Thank you very much in maker. Free songs no top up,POSITIVE
This app keeps on taking me to other songs i dkn't even want to watch whenâ‚© i press the play button it plays another song please fix this!,NEGATIVE
"Does the job when it works, but half the time it just doesn't connect/load. Fix this. I like that I can stream/connect to my home receiver. I have Premium, so can't comment on ads.",NEGATIVE
THIS IS THE GOD TIER APP. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP FOR A MUSIC FANS!!,POSITIVE
Music comes out very clear but when connect to Bluetooth headphones gets very quiet can barely hear the music even with volume turned all the way up,NEGATIVE
"My favorite apps. Add fiture listen music together in different device to sing along with them, even when far apart. Where is the lyric???",POSITIVE
It relax the mind and feel better it is the best and favourite app,POSITIVE
The app is just bad. Glitchy and unintuitive and has been for a decade. Good luck if you like podcasts.,NEGATIVE
ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’¯ it's an great app for all type of music ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
"Spotify creates some mixes for you based on your taste of music, creating you maybe your favorite Playlist and finding more songs. They have a big variety of music as well.",POSITIVE
"Its great, at least I felt it it plays songs automatically according to your interest but it need some time after using it for at least month I felt that Spotify knew what I wanted to listen",NEGATIVE
Amazing....only wish is provide more to the Caribbean countries,POSITIVE
I love this app. YOU CAN LISTEN TO EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING YOU WANT.,POSITIVE
I tried many times but can't get it,NEGATIVE
"Exceptional,utterly the best,words fail me how good u are.",POSITIVE

It's a fantastic app but the constant adds that pop up all the time and it really bugs me when my I listen to my songs they should make premium free then after a year they should charge people Money,NEGATIVE
I made account and I forgot my password so I tried to make a new account but it kept saying this account has already been made would you like to log in so i could not ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« make a new account pls fix that,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify its easy to use and has great options but, I don't like it when I ask for Spotify to play Keith Urban and it doesn't pull it up to play his songs except for the ones I liked because it downloaded; always says I don't have internet connection but my phone shows I have plenty 5G full bars. I've closed the app completely, even restarted my phone several times, and checked out to see if I needed to do updates and everything is updated, and I also paid for duo plan. So what now? ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
Ill give this a 1 star because first of all this app is annoying when you make your own Playlist instead of listening on the skng that u added this a annoying different song played this so annoying i have to use all of my free skip to play the music that i wanted and second of all when you search a music then after u click it instead of playing the music that i reached another music was played c'mon what the heck is this i just wanted to listen to the music that i added and search for so please,NEGATIVE

Always has the music I'm looking for and great recommendations as well,POSITIVE

A lot of songs good mix always find band I'm looking for,POSITIVE
"Last couple of updates have been horrible! 1. No longer allows you to preview a song before adding it to playlist. Please fix this! 2. Has been skipping a lot or just doesn't play. 3. Everytime i restart a playlist, it plays a lot of the same songs I've already listened to. There are songs on there that i still have yet to hear. Side note... If you don't have premium, get a different app. Way too many ads. You get 2 songs and then a ton of ads...and the ads are long.",NEGATIVE
"I do not like the amount of advertisements that occur before,and after I play a song and when I search for a specific song it forces me to listen through a whole Playlist even though I only wanted to listen to 1 song.",POSITIVE
Amazing with premium i highly advice to use with premium because the price is affordable but they should introduce gifts where like they give out free premiums for a short amount of time,POSITIVE
"I tried to sign up and whenever I give my emali password it says that my email password is wrong but it was fully right when I try to log through link they gave us it says that the link is expired every time ,I wanna say this is the worst app I ever used!!!",NEGATIVE
This is the worst app I've ever seen in my whole life omg. I'm littrrally anoyed by this app. Lots of ads and it took me 2 hours to find the music i want because it keeps playing random musics that i didnt even want to.,NEGATIVE
I love this app and this app will be helpful for k-pop Stan's cause when a new song idols made and after some sec we can find it in Spotify....but sometimes for the ads I get distracted by the song so that's a only trouble for me nothing more I just love this appâœ¨ðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
The major problem with spotify mobile is I cannot listen to the songs I want. It always goes to a random playlist that plays everything else other than what I want to.,NEGATIVE
When i started using spotify i was using it for years until i can't even use this darn thing i kept experiencing different problems my app crashed and i can't choose my music because i need to buy premium if you choose a single music it won't let you play so maybe i recommend you to get a new app,NEGATIVE
The best app to listen music online i use free version but I didn't a lot of ads it's better than others music in ADS and ui,NEGATIVE
One of the best music application I have ever had. This application have all my favorite K-pop songs specially BTS songs ðŸ’œi purple you Spotify ðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
Stupid app suddenly stops working correctly and goes from being able to listen to albums and choose songs specifically off of an album to it just playing randomly and not letting you listen to full albums anymore. I wish I knew why the free account did this.,NEGATIVE
Great selection of music for all ages,POSITIVE
Spotify is great just lately there's a problem on android where if you go to open your notifications while the screen is locked it'll shift the lock screen player for spotify to the right and it becomes unusable. Sometimes force quitting the app will fix it othertimes I have to Uninstall and reinstall. Any permanent fix?,NEGATIVE
How the hell do you keep this dog water app from auto playing once it connects to a device?,NEGATIVE
App is not working properly it keep crashing from last 2 weeks.,NEGATIVE
"Everything was good but then the new update happened ): I hope you guys make the links for collaborative playlist valid permanently again because having to send a new link every 24 hours isn't ideal. Also, I hope lyrics had the option for translated and romanised versions",NEGATIVE
"Hello spotify, I give 3 stars to this app cause in Spotify every type of song there but not the famous song there whenever I try find a music in Spotify I didn't get it anywhere",NEGATIVE
Gives me the motivation to do it ðŸ’ª ðŸ™Œ âœ¨ï¸ ðŸ’¯ ðŸ˜Œ. If you have any balls get some if you dare..,POSITIVE
"3 ads every 2nd song, worst music app, download mod apk if you like this app but don't use original",NEGATIVE
"I love almost everything about Spotify! The only thing I have an issue with is when you are online and another person that is on your Spotify account is online. You can't listen on separate devices. You can change the music or podcast, but it will change theirs also. So you can only listen to one device at a time online. That is the only issue I have and I have had Spotify for many years and will continue to have it for many years to come.",NEGATIVE
Always love Spotify,POSITIVE

My downloads do not always play offline.,NEGATIVE
In Spotify . You need to play every song before you can get to your fav song . Literally why isn't there a option to choose songs rather than playing it randomly . It's a bad app and I want it to change it also we can't listen a song more than 1 time which is really annoying,NEGATIVE
"Please add a ""remove from suggestions"" option. !! Great app, grateful for accessibility to so many artists and albums. Really hope all the Artists and musicians are getting compensated properly. So much homogenisation due to internet exploitation. We all know that musicians bring honest hard work and deserve to earn real honest money from their efforts. Thank you, grateful to the artists. Peace",POSITIVE
If you are looking for a decent sound quality... It's not here. Low-Fi Podcastify says they don't care about introducing HiFi so you should all speak with your wallet and move to different provider. Don't care about podcasts. We want a good quality audio. Moving my whole family out of here.,NEGATIVE
Anyone experiencing a bug with the last update? It close itself and stop playing the music once the screen switches off,NEGATIVE
The update is just a no and I can't even Pick what song I want to hear anymore and it's annoying so I hope you can fix this and turn back to the old version,NEGATIVE
"It annoys me greatly that Daniel Ek is so rich off the back of this terrible app. It's the most buggy app I've ever had. Controls constantly disappear meaning the only way I can stop a track is to uninstall the entire app. Thankfully a family member is paying for it, not me!",NEGATIVE
I'am absolutely thrilled Spotify has the lyrics to almost every song I have downloaded so far. Now I can sing the whole song AND know what I'am singing!!! Thank you Spotify!,POSITIVE

The app it's fabulous you can get any music you want,POSITIVE
"Horrible experience, just after updating the app I can't play a single song. None of them can be heard. Sometimes the app itself doesn't open. Very disappointing ðŸ˜ž.",NEGATIVE
Can't even subscribe on the app. Very annoying,NEGATIVE
Super cool life-changing moment when I realised that Spotify premium was missing from my world!,NEGATIVE
Today i installed this app. But it's not playing any songs. I can't even make my own playlist. It keeps lagging. I can't even play any playlist. I can't follow my favourite artists. Overall it's not working. Please look into this matter.,NEGATIVE
Thank you spotify the reason i came here is to support BTSâ˜º I WAS AN ARMY since 2014. Sorry just now i rate you here... in a PROOF era... but you already know your doing good in your flatform... Once again...thank you from BTS ARMYðŸ’œðŸ’œ,POSITIVE
Spotify's shuffle will have you listening to the same 7 songs in a playlist of over 100 songs.,NEGATIVE
Best app for music!!!,POSITIVE
I'm new to this app though I tried to download some music but can't because I was requested to pick premium where I will be charged monthly .I thought that Downloads should be made free.,NEGATIVE
The lyrics won't appear whenever I play a song.,NEGATIVE
WTH! This app is glicthing so much.Please fix problem.,NEGATIVE
Absolutely love it 100 out of 100,POSITIVE
"Bad , bad , bad ..a very bad app to listen to music ..unless you buy premium ..fckung want the money only",NEGATIVE
"very good, but sometimes bugs out when switching between default and car mode",NEGATIVE
This app doesn't let me skip the songs and add additional songs to my playlists,POSITIVE
"It crashes after playing a few songs so uninstalled and reinstalled it and now, it just plainly crashes whenever I open it. I don't want my money to go to waste bc it's been 2 weeks and I still can't use the app.",NEGATIVE
"since the last update (4.5.22) i have the issue, that when i play my favorite songs, that the app sometimes enters into a song radio without me even deciding. hope the issue gets fixed asap. the ""recent recomendations"" of the app are just random playlists, not reflecting my actual recent music. as i dont listen to podcast, it's annoying that they always get recommended, even in languages i don't listen to.",NEGATIVE
"Why am I paying for this? Spotify used to be good. Now it lags, takes ages to play a song, player doesn't refresh with track details of current song, and it randomly stops playing every two - three songs. Who is running this circus. Its not that difficult to further develop good software without turning it into the toilet that these guys have created... Also tries and fails to open local mp3 files on android so you can no longer listen to anything saved locally",NEGATIVE
"My go to music app, their weekly personalized Playlist Playlist recommendation are always on spott! Many diffrent artist,and many diffrent style- from someone that goes from Death metal to Mozart in seconds- or from Norse music to opera, I've used Spotify for years and I won't stop Now",NEGATIVE
Great no hassle or interrupted fun!,POSITIVE
Out of 0 ðŸŒš very worst app Is not a Spotify addfy app ðŸŒš,NEGATIVE
"I've heard 3 songs and 9 advertisements. I time the ""30 min of free listening"" and it's 22 min between advertisements. Also, pay the artists that you're making money off of. I'm not paying for a subscription when artists only get a couple cents from you.",NEGATIVE
the app no longer works. when I sign in my Playlists are empty and any single song I play just won't load. As soon as I logged into the app it IMMEDIATELY started deleting all of my offline downloads. UPDATE: as of June 10th My problem hasn't fixed and many other people are having the EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!! And for people looking for a fix there isn't one... yet.,NEGATIVE
Everything Ok But When I Take Song Back It stuck in One Place Not Play either it runs auto Please fix this glitch it sucks alot,NEGATIVE
I dont like that you have to pay to get ability to choose what you listen to.,NEGATIVE
Worst app for lots of reasons 1. Can't repeat songs 2. Always shuffles songs when I go to play a son 3. Lots of ads to get premium 4. Keep getting podcasts when I listen to one song so anoying 5. Every morning it restarts my songs really anoying 6. The settings on it is so confusing 7. Don't like how I can't repeat songs.,NEGATIVE
The best music streaming app,POSITIVE
Best music app ever ðŸ˜ I would be lost without it âœŒï¸,POSITIVE
"SD card support for cache/offline doesn't work. Android 11. Spotify can't read or write to it. If I set it and don't immediately change to internal storage, it gets stuck on next restart and app is gonna be broken until I force eject the card. Reboots and reinstalls don't really work because, because Spotify will default to SD as memory to store files to. When it worked fine earlier, Spotify tried to read SD card too soon, before it got mounted by OS. That lead to loss of offline content earlier",NEGATIVE
Excellent for free that good I'm thinking going premium no more adverts there pretty annoying but u need to make money some way so I understand it ðŸ˜‰,POSITIVE
I absolutely love love loveeee Spotify.,POSITIVE
It's really irritating me.. There is no option for correct song Play on. Absolutely a damaze app..ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  Motherchod App is too more improvement needed..,NEGATIVE
Amazing songs collection with so many categories.. I'm in love with Spotify ðŸ’ž U can find any song on this app..ðŸ’¯most of the apps don't have..,POSITIVE
"They try to make you buy premium on phones by implementing the worst features imaginable, like forcefully modifying your Playlist, not allowing you to play the same song twice in a row, and numerous others. I can beat with ads and understand why they are there, but seeing them throw all the features onto phone exclusively is disgusting. If you want to get spotify, get it on iPad or tablet as it has many of the same features as premium on phone, just with ads.",NEGATIVE
Its lovely i love listing songs and its highy coality,POSITIVE
The best thing for me. Can listen too all the music I love Also podcast and books. Couldn't do without it.,POSITIVE
Terrific to be able to look up past songs& artists. Wish i could afford to go premium. Pension does not allow it.Unfortunately. Thankyou,POSITIVE

I love listening to music on this app. Good tunes for you to listen in the car or walking. Do recommend .also very good with headphones/eaebuds.,POSITIVE
"This was a 5 star rating when I had premium. Now it is a 1 star rating. They add songs to my playlist and refuse to play the songs I put on my lists, instead they force me to listen to the worst music in history. You can only skip 5 songs and they always play more of their own before they play yours. Ads after every 3 songs.bcant skip those either. It's truly a horrible and frustrating experience!! Don't use this app, find a better music service that costs less or is free.",NEGATIVE
"The first download this music app, everything is normal. But , after some time when I turn on the offline mode, some of album art not appeared. Please fixed this issues",NEGATIVE
Song pauses for a while while turning on the screen,NEGATIVE
The app limitations such as playlists are annoying,NEGATIVE
It had moments when it would give ads after ads but now it is far better!,POSITIVE
"Way too much ads, one of them indicates that you get ""30 minutes of free listening"" , then you get an ad straight after the next song? It is okay overall, but way too many ads.",NEGATIVE
This has been a great deal with the best variety of affordable music to suit anyone's tastel,POSITIVE
It only lets me play 10 seconds of a song I've uninstalled it and everything.ðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Great app for listening music. But sometimes adds interrupt the music and that's painful.,NEGATIVE
Love spotifv. So easy to understand and the song selection is endless. Definitely the best music app out there!!!!0,POSITIVE
Terribly made and not user friendly take your time and money somewhere else,NEGATIVE
Paying for duo it's good it's just not got all the songs have been looking and Alexa is a nightmare when it comes to Spotify,NEGATIVE
Really annoying. The song i clicked on literally never played. It would play wome other song insted. I tryed this with multiple songs.,NEGATIVE
"Sorry I'm gonna give this 3 stars cause the update made it frustrating to use and there's no loop button anymore, so please fix this Spotify",NEGATIVE
"I've been a spotify user for easily over a decade. Paying Â£15pm for a service that's increasingly getting worse. Constantly switches devices alone, cuts out and needs updates. The fact they allow ads on a premium service via manipulating the release radar to some of the worst, tacky, fiat 500 chav music is insulting. Really debating that switch to prime music because Spotify is terrible.",NEGATIVE
i like it but i cannot see the lyrics i dot kniw why but can u fix this,NEGATIVE
Very simple and nice app to use. Love the playlists it curates for me at times they just spot on. Great algorithm,POSITIVE
I've loved this app for yrs now and it's only got better if that say anything..it's great download it worth it ..,POSITIVE

"I don't get it, my favorite feature is gone. You can't preview songs anymore when creating a playlist!!!! Why??? Kind of pointless now. I'm trying other streaming apps now.",NEGATIVE
joyfully music and experience,POSITIVE
"Tge app is overall very good,but the app pushes you so much to buy premium with adds,and there are no offline listening option without premium and there are many apps that give this feature for free.",POSITIVE
Music library is completely disappeared even liked songs. Disappointing wasting my time and money.,NEGATIVE

Keeps logging me out and am currently trying to log back in nothing is working and it keeps saying it sent me a link and it doesnt show up.

"Was working fine with no problems until last update, connects to Bluetooth through my car and it shows that the song is playing but no sound. I've done all the troubleshooting as this problem has seemed to occur in past updates but no luck. Pretty much only listen to Spotify in the car so definitely not worth my monthly premium subscription. Disappointing.",NEGATIVE

"I cant play the song i want,i cant find songs only playlist pls change this",NEGATIVE

Always have the newest music and very few adds its my favorite streaming app.,NEGATIVE
Spotify used to be great but recently the app has begun to fail to load content or find search results. I've been a premium subscriber since the very start however if the issues aren't fixed soon I'll be leaving the platform entirely as it's become incredibly frustrating.,NEGATIVE
"i genuinely cannot understand who made the decision to not allow users to play samples of songs before adding them to playlists, but it makes creating playlists and discovering new music so difficult. im not sure if this is just the experience for android users or free users, but i need this feature back.",NEGATIVE

Absolutely couldn't live without Spotify 1000/10,POSITIVE
"Good app after all, but it's not. Playing suggested songs instead of the songs we want to listen to is annoying. I won't waste my money on premium for playing my own songs because I want to have money and not be broke. You guys are just trying to make money like that so we can stop complaining. Nice try. Won't get my money. I won't ever trust premium. Plus not everyone has money to afford premium whether it's expensive it cheap for them. So what will they do? Nothing.",NEGATIVE

Please bring back the preview option. Also too many ads,NEGATIVE
I would give it 5 stars if it doesn't containt the shuffle mode that you can't turn off and also the adds that tells you how it will b good if you get spotify premium so i hope you really delete These things that bind you.,POSITIVE
Love that I can set up my own music playlists. And the playlist they create for me based of what I like are great.,POSITIVE
Nice songs on the play listðŸ™‚ðŸ‘,POSITIVE

"Good Vibes, Great Selection of ðŸŽ¶ music",POSITIVE
"Brilliant app! Loads of songs, playlists and podcasts! Heck, I was even surprised when i found ASMR on here. One thing; why did I literally have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get the lyrics feature? Not a major gripe, but it's just strange that I didn't just have to update. Either way, great service!",NEGATIVE
Love Spotify it's been the best since day 1!!,POSITIVE
"I'm ready to switch to Amazon music. Shuffle option is just horrendously bad. I have a playlist with 16 hours of music with shuffle mode for my bike riding (and sorted by title as suggested by a user) but I keep hearing the same songs over and over. I have tried everything including reinstalling but still just horrendous shuffle. I'm going to trial Amazon music now and if better, bye bye Spotify.",NEGATIVE

Can only play a preview of my liked songs and it's the same in any playlist I make and if I want to hear a full song then I can only press the shuffle button and hope.,NEGATIVE
"Best music app, highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Totally useless app, they have a shuffle feature, which is so annoying, and you can not get back to your previous song , i mean seriously, the owner company of this app is just money greeders, only if u choose a premium plan then you can play any song , otherwise they shuffle the playlist,and you will never be able to play your favourite song, also the track line of the songs doesn't work, so you cannot skip the in unnecessary part of song, i wish i can give 0 star to this app .",NEGATIVE
"App keeps playing up, keeps stopping what is playing & marks things as played that haven't finished. Often can't pause things as the play button doesn't work properly. Often doesn't show details of what is playing with the bar at the bottom so you are unable to search through podcasts etc.",NEGATIVE
Best thing since microwave pot pies!,POSITIVE
"The go to app when I need HQ, uninterrupted and pure sounds",NEGATIVE
It keeps randomizing the music I can't stop it it needs to stop showing me the album of the song I wrote I deleted it because it keeps stressing me out I can't listen to the song I want and when I do find it it's just 10 seconds of it I had the song in my liked and albums but now I can only listen 10 seconds of it and switching the song to others please fix it,NEGATIVE
Nice to be able to make your own playlist,POSITIVE
The music for you is actually good and picks put similar artists to what you listen to.,POSITIVE
Really like this app. It has an amazing list of songs. I am curious about why some songs aren't availible - why are they listed. The neverending updates aten't always the best. Could use a tutorial/manual for some things. And to he'll with cancel culture!,POSITIVE
I love all of the options I have to listen to music on Spotify. Awesome!,POSITIVE
"Once again broken since the last update, this time the wrong music plays when first selecting a song.",NEGATIVE
All my favorites and great variety.,POSITIVE

Had iheart app Spotify so much better ! Glad I switched.,NEGATIVE
Easy to use and music of all genres,POSITIVE
It's very good for being able to listen to whoever you want to listen to.,POSITIVE

"Anyone not read the data they collect, not at all creepy. Now I hate the added songs they throw in or mix when you just tryna listen to a song lol ðŸ˜ ",NEGATIVE
"It's a good app but recently I have had a huge problem with listening to music. Whenever I am using the app, it doesn't let me leave the app and listen to music. I have to stay in the app no matter what. I have tried connecting to wifi for it to load but it does nothing. I can't even turn my phone off or the music won't play.",NEGATIVE
It's free and great. But or limited on skips. I have switch to YouTube I have to listen to commercials just like Spotify but unlimited skips that's the big difference and why I listen to YouTube more than I do Spotify,NEGATIVE
"The app is SO SLOW. Slow to open, slow to load, slow to switch speakers, slow to load library, slow to show playlists. Please optimize it. No other apps behave this slow.",NEGATIVE
I love this app and that I can get my favorite Christian music.,POSITIVE
It changes to a random song a song that I don't even care about and then I have to just play a different thing which then it's going to do that the same way and I really wish you could just keep it the shuffle play that I do even if it's not unlike song stop switching the dumb thing I recommend no one doing this I hate it,NEGATIVE
Why is there cover image as my lockscreen background. Could you please remove that feature. It's really irritating. No other platform does that (or gives you the option to remove it) it destroys the minimalist approach I tend to do on phone.,NEGATIVE
Amazing app but... the shuffle feature is not the best,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify,the songs are my favorite.",POSITIVE
I hated having ads so I went premium a year or two ago and I love Spotify because I love the music of my life and with Spotify I no longer have to keep an album collection with me. They handle that!,POSITIVE
Great and dynamic,POSITIVE
I love how easy it is to use and truly you can get any song. I love it!!! I've tried baby other apps and this is by far the best!!!,POSITIVE
"Podcast playlists don't have a shuffle toggle off option. If you shuffle a music playlist then play a podcast playlist, your podcast playlist will shuffle until you go back to music and toggle shuffle.",NEGATIVE
"Pretty good app but even though songs have been in a playlist for ages the app decides music from my device is no longer worthy of being played. I cannot add it back into to the playlist if i remove it, it just greys it out & doesn't give me an option to do anything but like the song. The only way to rectify is delete all the data & cache then reinstall the app. Annoying to say the least",NEGATIVE
"Spotify helped me fall asleep with the podcasts a lot, but I will only give 4 stars since sometimes it's just useless add pushing into everything.",NEGATIVE
"Probably my most used all over the last decade. But over the last couple months it's gotten embarrassingly bad and I wonder why I keep paying for an app that rarely works. Update: this app is only getting worse by the day it seems and has turned into a complete waste of money, I hope they figure out how to make it run like it has for years with no issues but until then I just can't justify spending money every month on a music app that I can hardly get to play music. Update: still buggy",NEGATIVE
Way too many ads. Plus the app UI has way fewer features than the full website.,NEGATIVE
Please kannada God songs added hope albums but super awesome app,POSITIVE
"The app tells me to go online in order to get search results. While I don't have a great connection, I do have a connection. In fact, I am writing this 1 star review via my connection right now",NEGATIVE
"It would have been 5 Stars but the last time I went on, within one hr I heard the same damn YouTube advertisement played. Only two other ads played during that whole time.",NEGATIVE

Love this I can click out of the app and still listen to good music,POSITIVE
"When did this app drop the bar so low that it has become such trash. Constant disconnections, anytime you pause and go back to the shuffle it plays all the songs that just played. It's honestly a pain in the butt just to make it work normally. Raise the bar and fix your ish.",NEGATIVE
This app doesn't play the songs I want,NEGATIVE
It a great app to listen music at any time.ðŸŽµðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE

Wish you could unload your music for off line enjoyment.,NEGATIVE
"Edit 09/06: They fixed it, thanks! Who ever signed off on having the ""go back"" button replaced by the ""like"" button in the notification bar please reverse it. People don't click like on songs nearly as much as they click on previous track.",NEGATIVE
I TRY TO PLAY A SONG BUT IT PLAYS ANOTHER SONG!!! WHY!! I WANNA LISTEN TO MY FAVOURITE SONG,NEGATIVE
I had to delete and uninstall this app more than one time and I still have the same problem with it it's somehow decides to automatically start playing. Even over other media audio applications plus they keep changing the location of where you can shut off the permissions for that. It's absolutely trash and I would suggest that no one use it because it takes takes over too many permissions on your phone and it really really does spy on your privacy,NEGATIVE
Desktop is just simply superior. I don't know why I'd ever use mobile when I can't even select a specific song.,POSITIVE
I would give this 5 stars but when I make a playlist it has an annoying we added and i hate it because i hate all those songs and there is no way to get rid of them so if you fix it i will change my review and also i get ads every 5 min so can you lower the ads to like 1 every 10 min pls also they have alot of songs but there little MEME songs so it's difficult to have a laugh just change the we added and I'll give you a 5 star rating and reccomend this app to my friends,NEGATIVE
This app is terrible and getting worse. Very buggy and non-responsive. About 5 minutes from getting rid of Spotify for good.,NEGATIVE

Love it all the time no commercials,POSITIVE
It's horrible that Spotify sponsors The Joe Rogan Experience podcast which spreads misinformation and prejudice. I cannot in good conscious use Spotify; I am removing Spotify from all of my devices. (I hope other people will do the same...),NEGATIVE
I am a premium user. I listen to many kind of genres and music from many other country but spotify's algorithm makes me annoyed. Spotify needs to understand that an English rock song and a Japanese rock song should be in a daily mix together. NOT a Japanese metal song and a Japanese pop song. Please make a algorithm that saperates genres not languages. I go to sleep listening to a indie calm Korean song and then a very aggressive Korean rap song starts to play then I wake up I'm sick of this.,NEGATIVE
"So far the best music streaming App, ever",POSITIVE
Stotify this the best music app I've found.....please download this app if you like music.,POSITIVE

Best audio streaming app used ever !,POSITIVE

"Most music on it, not good to use while in heavy depression and you can't afford premium so forced to listen ads as you contemplate your life",NEGATIVE
"Leaving reviews on Play is completely useless, but please fix this app. It keeps crashing.",NEGATIVE
Good collection of songs,POSITIVE
Excellent way to listen to your favorite music and learn about new ones!!,POSITIVE
I'm bringing down my rating until we get CD quality music. So many other services offer it now at the base price but not Spotify.,NEGATIVE

I was YT music user before and I left that app because I have to pay just to play music background.. Btw Thanks a lot Spotify for giving us free musicâ™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,NEGATIVE
Always showing no internet even though music is streaming online,NEGATIVE
"I can't listen to a song before I add it anymore, I can't change the order of songs in a playlist, or do anything. On Chromebooks you can do all of this but on phones your not allowed to, I find it very annoying and hard to make playlists when I can't hear the song before I put it in.",NEGATIVE

"You may still get ads with a premium account. My downloaded songs cut in and out. The pause play button doesn't always pop up when a song is selected, even after restarting the app.",NEGATIVE

Just the ads are annoying,NEGATIVE
"Annoying!!! Please move it back how it was or make it better. I can't just pick the song I want from my list, I have to skip other songs to get what I want. It just plays the song for about 10s, you can see the circle spinning and goes back to the one I was listening previously. Annoying!!! Again. What did you do? It took my a while to figure it out how to make it work. It's not intuitive at all... Will change my review after it's fixed, please make it good. But now, I'm annoyed.",NEGATIVE
Spotify all I've been needed,NEGATIVE
"Ad breaks replay when you rewind. Find it annoying when an ad interrupts the thought or sentence? Want to rewind and replay the last sentence without an ad break? Nope! The ad will play again when you play over the same point. Maybe it's intentional, but if so, why would I put up with it? Maybe it's a glitch and you'll fix it? I guess you don't test your builds before releasing them. Once again, why would I put up with it? I'm just gonna uninstall and download the raw audio.",NEGATIVE
Sometimes has troubles loading up pls fix that,NEGATIVE
"A very good application for streaming music, obviously with ads without premium",POSITIVE

"love this app, the best is when i have no ads, so good",POSITIVE
Way to many ads. Stop trying to get poor people to pay sh**.,NEGATIVE
"I really wish Spotify add more customisation for Profiles and Playlist. Like a background for Playlist and Profile, where we can use Gif as well.",NEGATIVE
If i turn on gapless it will turn off back,NEGATIVE
Constant problems but when there aren't any problems it works great. I would like to suggest to have a button that sorts the playlists by genre,NEGATIVE
"The app constantly doesn't work, but I guess that's what you get with Spotify premium",NEGATIVE
"It's great when it works, but sometimes you're just paying for an app to give you the bird...",POSITIVE
"Shuffle feature is trash, can't listen to one specific song, too many ads, and too many songs not allowed to stay on the app its annoying.",NEGATIVE
PLEASE FIX! Latest update constantly skips songs every couple seconds when you connect it to a Bluetooth device,NEGATIVE
App have to much updates or ads in every 10 my minutes and many of songs are not available on it... It has waste of data,NEGATIVE
"Whenever i play a song, it always stops at 9sec. I tried everything but still doesnt work.",NEGATIVE
I don't understand what just suddenly happened to this app. The Song that I'm playing is only played for 10 seconds and then it stucks right there. I tried to play several songs and the same is happening. Please fix it,NEGATIVE
Songs stop playing after 9 seconds.,NEGATIVE
I hate that I can't turn off shuffle play.,POSITIVE
"It A Gud App But You Can,t Put Your Fav Music In A Loop Without Buyying It But Im Broke No We Are *Yaws* Hope We Can Do It On A Loop For Free. X]",NEGATIVE
Why is it taking so long to play a song one after another????,NEGATIVE
There's a glitch recently where it auto skips through songs. And won't play more than 3 or 4 secs of each song. Had this app for years and it just started doing it.,NEGATIVE
Songs are not able to play even after updating the latest version,NEGATIVE
"After EVERY song and ever CLICK there's two or three ads playing you cannot skip. If you make a playlist it adds random songs you can't remove. If you click a song everything plays BUT the song. You only get 6 skips per day, or 1 or no additional every hour. There's a bug or glitch that replays a small part at the very beginning of a song, you have to reopen the app or it won't stop. Don't download. Sometimes the music just stops playing and I have to reinstall it. Fix it.",NEGATIVE
What is this kind of problem? My Wi-Fi has high-speed network but the song isn't playing. Is this maintenance problem?,NEGATIVE
Ugh. My internet is working just fine but the song won't play.,NEGATIVE
Worst music app. Stops working in middle of songs.,NEGATIVE

"Its an awesome app for streaming music. You need it trust me. Hey Spotify team. Help my account, I can't renew my subscription since last month. All the cards I've tried using isn't going through whats up?",POSITIVE
I love it I have been using this for music a lot,POSITIVE
"Horrible, why is it the music I want to listen to won't load but you have no problem with loading ads? Why is it when you listen to an ad to get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music it almost never works? Why do you make me listen to a half hour of ads every couple songs? An ad here and there is understandable but a half hour come on. Why is it when I go to my liked songs and click to play a certain genre it plays everything but that genre? Why would I want to go premium when you can't fix this",NEGATIVE
"This app has countless bugs related to its ad service. More than 50% of the time it gets stuck in an endless loop of just playing ads, and will never actually play any music. In cases where this doesn't happen, if will only play the first 9 seconds of the first song in the music playlist and then freeze. I have experienced across multiple app platforms for several years now, and there has been no improvement to the service.",NEGATIVE
Always stopping for no reason lately,NEGATIVE
"Every song I play always stops at 00:09, and I use the premium. Fix this asap.",NEGATIVE
Lags. The song (even at any playlist) stops and doesn't play even at good internet connection at exactly 0:09. Fix this bug.,NEGATIVE
"Well, this application is very good and so on, but something started happening to me two hours ago, which is that the songs stop when they reach nine seconds. I deleted the application and re-downloaded it, but it is useless. Please give me a solution",NEGATIVE

"like everytime i play songs and it reaches exactly 9 seconds it just stops and it pisses me off, an inconvenience happened to me twice the first one was it wont show what song was playing and now this!",NEGATIVE
My daily routine is dry without Spotify. Spotify is my monsoon.ðŸ˜€,NEGATIVE
It just a very good app. Only down side is it glitches sometimes.,POSITIVE
"Music catalog is great, Ads are not!",NEGATIVE
"Got hit by the reset and delete bug that Spotify refuses to admit exists. Woke up this morning without music because I had to log in to Spotify, breaking my Google assistant morning routine. Would discover shortly after leaving later that day that ALL of my downloaded music for offline listening had been deleted along with all my settings. I have a premium account, a paid account with Spotify and this is what happened. Not the first, won't be the last.",NEGATIVE
Good app every song is not available though,NEGATIVE
What a world of diffrence between free and premium .... Definetly upgradexto premium now,NEGATIVE
Pretty good app. You can add just about as many songs to a Playlist as you please. But after a certain point it stops telling you how many hours are in the Playlist. Also with one of the newer updates it won't let you look at songs to add to a Playlist you have to search each one individually. I think it would also be nice if we could add whole albums to a playlist,NEGATIVE
But in Android there are some glitches and bugs while opening some times all works well except search and shows that no song matches,NEGATIVE
"Love the App. I've used Spotify for a long time. Premium is so useful. I can find so much more, and create awesome playlists. Anyways!! ** I can't stand the fact you CAN NOT unsubscribe through the app!** It is Ludicrous.",POSITIVE

edit:trial ended.Make a play list then it gets filled with bs and then limit 6 skips per hour very strange .Good for podcasts though,NEGATIVE
Noice very coolðŸ‘ a bit to much for ads but still very nice.,POSITIVE
you were great before even if not premium users appreciated you before but now even if I purchased premium it's still disappointing.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify meets all your need and music you like to listen to on a daily basis! no matter what Genre, spotify is accessible and available to all and has a great premimuim monthly deal for those who do not like adds and skip songs on the daily.",POSITIVE
"Charges 10 fold for trial - $10 instead of $3/3 months being regular price; gets snagged after about an hour & won't play, & subtitles will not display on TV screen. Ah, now it's quitting after 10 min - via Cast. Yt, Netflix, Prime, Pandora, none have same issue",NEGATIVE

Amazing app best app for listening to music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
It's insane that literally anything BUT shuffle is held behind a paywall. Would rate it 0/5 if I could because this app literally just wasted my time and nothing else.,NEGATIVE
"Using it and everything is SO annoying when I've finished a play list i made it played suggested songs instead of stopping or restarting, also I can't chose a song to play in my liked songs, it just makes me shuffle them, Extremely annoying",NEGATIVE
Im giving this one star because whenever i want to listen music on my playlist it just change in other song i hate it! And it really annoys me ALOT and if i tap the song it just plays other song which is so stupid! Hope you understand what i mean because i just waste my time in this stupid app!,NEGATIVE
Disappointing that this is the best music app right now,POSITIVE
I Love this app and there has so many songs my favourite song is there but to one problem is there there has so many ad that's why I am giving only 4 star,NEGATIVE
It does not play the song I want. When i search the song with title it plays another song. It is annoying. What has happened?,NEGATIVE
I only played my fav songs in just 1 week. It needs to be paid before u can play again ur fav songs. But im broke bruh.,NEGATIVE
I listen all songs i love useing spotify i rate 5 its best for songs i respect that alot,POSITIVE
Overall it's a good app but the new update doesn't let you skip parts of the songs wich would be fine but i sometimes want to backtrack on songs that i have played before and when you play playlist it goes back to the song you were at and it also goes back on the same timestamp wich sucks when playing a different playlist and then returning to the other one and one last thing you can't start on wich song you want on your liked playlist. Fix these problems,NEGATIVE
"I love it, just hate when songs are unplayable...like y? Other than that. Great, 8/10",NEGATIVE

Awesome app for listening music every music is on Spotify,POSITIVE
It's great. I just wish when you vist a artist profile you had a option to see every song they have (on the platform) in like one playlist or something.,POSITIVE
"The podcast feature is not great: it can't find some podcasts which are available on the service when i search, and it says'Sometning went wrong' when I try to add them with the Spottify link. It also shows EVERY different show from some multi-show creators when you search for one show by name but it won't let you subscribe to only one of them!",NEGATIVE
Love this app been using it for a couple of years no problems found at all,POSITIVE
"So I love this music platform it's just that when I create a playlist spotify will add songs without me saying to and then just not play any of my songs at all. And I don't want to buy premium, because I'm using a school account and school said we weren't aloud too. And I would have given it 5 stars but I can't, because I never get to listen to any songs that i pick. And I get you have to have premium for that but some people can't get premium!",NEGATIVE
I love it :) my husband and I we use it everyday ðŸ’Ÿ,POSITIVE
Easy to use with some devices,POSITIVE
Spotify turns on automatically even when the app is closed and starts playing songs from the radio when i use ear plugs This is very annoying please fix this issue,NEGATIVE
"* navigation between the various screens within the app makes sense * when i click on a song to play from the search results, the list stays on there for me so i could select something else to play if i wanted to - it doesn't disappear or take me elsewhere * continues to work in background and while screen is turned off * my phone is fossil old and yet it works on it, isn't slow, doesn't consume much battery! * auto-plays interesting, relevant music based on the track i start off with",NEGATIVE
Experience been great so far! Really enjoy using it...,POSITIVE

"I love the to old school R&B on Spotify and love it when the app makes mixes tha include a bit of everything. Great to listen to while driving with no annoying, like you get on the FM radio station",POSITIVE
"Spotify does A/B testing all the time. It's unfortunate I fell under it and now have to see the ugliest UI in the history where play button is on left and previous/next button is in middle of nowhere. I really hope the UI designer stops talking the ""stuff"" and do not screw the working UI",NEGATIVE
Best app for listening song â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"Please allow people to change theme, I personally don't like apps with black design.",POSITIVE
I really like it. But I want to have the option to turn on recommended songs.,POSITIVE
Bad . I hope they'll add that features in spotify pc for this . I can't even listen to a selected song in my liked songs . Very bad experience,NEGATIVE
". As stale as the coffee cake you'd find in your grandmothers fridge. Considering the other apps and the offerings they provide, I have a feeling that it's going to be a while before I download this app again.",NEGATIVE
App is horrible! ! It is so hard to use and understand how to use. When you try to play a song it plays a different song and you can't even play you play list without premium and if you can how?! I can not figure out this app. Please make it easier and make it so you CAN play the song you want,NEGATIVE

Brilliant app. Very reliable.,POSITIVE
20/12/18-Stops and closes randomly all of a sudden. It used to do this but then stopped for a while. Its done it 3 times in the last 15 minutes. Very irritating 20/5/21- 3 years on and this issue is back again after last update . 9/6/22- oh look its still happening. 4 years... Really???why am I still playing for this.,NEGATIVE
"Premium user so not sure if that changes my app functionality in any way. Video podcasts are still broken on my LG VELVET 5G, even after updating to Android 12. This has been the case for over two months now. Playing a podcast with video (with all settings set properly) only shows a black screen whether in the player preview or in full screen. Spotify also often locks up or plays something without it showing in the player, essentially ""phantom playing"" media which requires a restart.",NEGATIVE
"Play bar keeps disappearing, was restarting the app to fix but that isn't working now. Anoying if you are halveway in a long podcast, close or change playable and have to re listen to eg 30 min of content to get back -samsung Android.",NEGATIVE
Feel happy to listen this songs.,POSITIVE

I love using Spotify for my alarm wake-up music.,POSITIVE
"I mean, it's a great app to listen songs with but there are some issues going on. When I play songs, I couldn't rewind a certain part of it though I was able to a few days ago? Why is it that the shuffle buttons are gone like, the buttons where if you tap it, it'll replay the same song? This app is confusing, seriously. I just want to listen to songs that's it.",NEGATIVE
The best app for music i luv it super app all language music is here â¤,POSITIVE
Best music app of all timeeee!!!!,POSITIVE
"Only plays the specific song you want only with premium. I have to ""buy"" the song if I want to play it.",NEGATIVE
"When you search for a specific song like song that has long title since it's an OST, results are very INACCURATEðŸ™ƒ",NEGATIVE
SPOTIFY PLEASE TAKE OFF YOUR DAMN PODCATS THAT LOOKS LIKE PORN ON MY FRONT PAGE. SO DISTURBING FOR KIDS AND IT ANNOYS ME THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE CANT TAKE IT OFF !,NEGATIVE
It is money every where ðŸ¤‘ not what you can control so useless app,NEGATIVE
I used this app for 2 mabby 3 weeks to a month and then it went to all of my playlist and added thousands of songs I didn't want I got this app so I could have my songs as alarms wen that happened It kept putting random songs I didn't want for my alarms but anny way before that happens it was fine I prefer Amazon music also I don't want to pay the price for premium or whatever so ya I uninstalled Spotify,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify, but why and how does this app keep doing it's own thing and randomly opening itself, then casting music to my Nest Hub, both by Bluetooth and over WiFi.",NEGATIVE
"As a paid user, i cannot edit list and so called akward recommendation in homepage, FINE. ""your top mixes"", ""more of what you like"", ""your show"", ""uniquely you"", ""based on your recent listening"", ""made for you"" etc are all similar meaning. why make the homepage become worse and so confusing. not user friendly. LIST TOO LOOOONG. can't make list professional like youtube?",NEGATIVE
"They still continue to screw up accounts, and suck out downloaded songs on a daily basis. Leave my downloads the F-alone. It's why I pay you. Customer service is useless. You asked me rate you again. You lose a star.",NEGATIVE
No time to review for a complete and thorough analysis!,NEGATIVE
"guts, click the permissions tree before downloading this app, it collects your personal phone number, emails, pictures voice data, gestures used, AND stores it on a probably hackable server using its quote unquote secure transmissions but they wont elaborate on how its transferred or anything. DO NOT DO IT guys, we are all on YT music (Youtube music, red and white pic) or soundcloud lately. More news to come later, i think a boycott is in-order gentlemen....!@!",NEGATIVE
Great app ðŸ‘. It has a lot of ads but if you buy premium it's great.,POSITIVE
I really like the app but I have some lag issues but then again it's really good,POSITIVE

Sensational music choice but make it easy for listening by not force play a Playlist we're not on it my faves then I was forced to hip hop,POSITIVE
This app sucks because it adds song I don't want to my playlist and I can't find a way around it. If I want a certain song from my playlist and I click on it it just plays a little bit of it. I also can't go back if I want to listen to a song again. idk if I have to get premium or something for this type of stuff. The only thing I like about it is that it plays when my phone is off or when I'm on some other app But I would rather just use YouTube and leave my phone on and let the music play :\,NEGATIVE
"Always great , just adding the fact that if i had less Bill's basically >family man< , so but ya I'd absolutely pay for the premium Spotify, it for sure Kicks some you know what a--ss Never mind 5 stars how about 6 Thanks Spotify for also supplying the free streaming service much appreciated ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒâœŒâ˜ï¸ðŸ¤™ ðŸ‘ ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›",POSITIVE
The downloads that are suppose to play offline... Don't.,NEGATIVE
The play/pause bar has been going missing for months. Nothing done by tech. Playing downloaded songs requires changing setup to off-line playback. That's dumb. Its because I don't have internet access then that's why I'm playing only downloaded songs. Switching back and forward is tiresome within the app. Needs a do-over. I just want to play music and not get annoyed by the app.,NEGATIVE
Love this app but after every song or maybe two it pauses the music. Not only does it pause but I have to open my phone and the app fully for it to start playing.,NEGATIVE
"I like spotify, it's easy to sign up and has a wide range of songs. the main problem is that when i open up the app it freezes and crashes. another problem is that there are a lot of ads. it says listen to this ad to get 30 minutes uninterupted, but after like one song which is about 2-5 minutes, another ad pops up.",NEGATIVE
Widget is back! Thank you,POSITIVE
"Good App, I wish tho I could be able to have a Playlist of all my music in one place, like the music I have searched or played before",NEGATIVE
Amazing app and you should totally consider getting it if you don't already have it. The only down side about it is you have ads if you don't get premium buuut premium is ONLY $9.99.,NEGATIVE
I am giving it a 1 star Bec when the free month ends it becomes the worst app ever it doesn't let me choose to play a song it makes me play it for a very short time and it is too expensive,NEGATIVE
My app plays random songs. This has been happening for at least 3 weeks now. I am trying to practice my patience but I am having problems. Can anyone help me?,NEGATIVE
Does not save songs and charged after 3 months after deleting account. Not happy.,NEGATIVE
Highly recommend this app! The only flaws are how many skips you get. Hope you enjoy if you decide to get it!,POSITIVE
It's trash i can't even listen to the music.,NEGATIVE
"Overall, this app is great. I like the option of being able to listen to podcasts as well. But spotify, please work on your shuffle of songs! I have 747 songs and I swear I hear the same 10 songs in a row.",POSITIVE
It runs will just skip podcast while in the middle of listening and no 30 second preview when adding to Playlist. The app is getting worse with each update. I will be back in a month or 2 to change it to 1 star shortly.,NEGATIVE
this app is amazing though it takes a max of 3 minutes to load,POSITIVE
"Good song selection but SO MANY BUGS. Spotify, you have to stop trying to load my DOWNLOADED SONGS on wifi, it is so infuriating. Also, I often click on my downloaded ""liked playlist"" and it shows up blank. Please fix your app",NEGATIVE
Been having issues throwing music directly onto the TV from the app and using the cast feature and I know it's not my cast device or TV because YouTube works just fine,NEGATIVE
crashes after a few seconds whenever i try to open any other apps. doesn't play stuff at all quite often,NEGATIVE
My experience with spotify has been great I can find 90% of the music I love.,POSITIVE

Easy to find new and old favorites.,POSITIVE
I love this app I rate it number 1 music app,POSITIVE
"Why the fugk can I not disable this app from blasting every time I start my car? If I want to listen to something I will open the app. It's extremely annoying and I'm very close to canceling this service because of this issue. The disable battery feature use to work, but ever-increasing the android update it starts itself weather I want it to or not.",NEGATIVE
I really enjoy Spotify. They have a awesome selection of Music I like They are the bomb..,POSITIVE
"Wide range of music, simple to use my 6yr old loves it able to find music I used to listen to as a teenage in the eighties,",POSITIVE
"pretty good just not all songs I look for, I find",POSITIVE
If I could give negative stars I would. I recently opted out of my Spotify premium subscription because I don't use the sevice enough. I open the app today and start playing music as normal. As soon as I change stations I get trapped in a loop of ads for over 5 minutes. Changing stations and pausing did nothing to alleviate the issue. Aggravating to say the least.,NEGATIVE
Can't go back to a previous song. Can't listen to a specific song. Can't listen to a playlist in order. Keeps adding songs to my playlists without permission. I try to listen to songs from a specific artist and it adds songs from other artists. App is missing basic functions. Spotify is trash ðŸ—‘,NEGATIVE
Unable to stop autoplay when connecting to BT in car,POSITIVE
"This may be worse than youtube music as far as music apps go, i just want one specfic song and cant even play that cause it puts it in a play list like dude i dont care about your recommendations just let me play the song i specifically looked up",NEGATIVE
"Not sure if anyone reads these, but the latest Android version (8.7.36.923) keeps crashing and loading very slowly. The app is semi-unusable. Again. Do you even do beta testing at all? his is my favorite app for streaming albums, playlists, and podcasts. What is up for the recent push for videos? The chief beauty of Pandora is its ability to play in the background!",NEGATIVE
Music comes clear and great sound. If yours sounds tinny it would be because of the media you are using. I use a U2 boom box and the clarity and volume is great. The ads are pretty short and no way near what you get on a radio station plus you only listen to your favourites.,POSITIVE
Enjoying the music. Very little to no interruptions! Great mix of music as well.,POSITIVE
Great selection and easy to use.,POSITIVE
Crashing a ton since the new update Edit has stopped crashing,NEGATIVE
I like the variety of artists that this app has to offer.,POSITIVE
Works perfectly just it hard to navigate my way around the app,NEGATIVE
I hate how yall play songs that arent even in the playlist i wanna play and also the ads are really annoying theres like a ad after every song,NEGATIVE

Very good no problem Best music app My favorite app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ˜ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
"Sure it has infinate free music. But for every song there is at least 3 ads. It wasnt always this way but now it is. Instead it used to go ""click her to 30 minutes of ad free music"" but now those ads dont exsist so ur stuck with the 3 for every song. Also your ""liked songs playlist""? Completely useless. U can go to it and press shuffle play, but will it play the songs that u pressed the like button on? Nooo. It plays songs u have never heard of. Like seriously wth is that. So find a diffrent app",NEGATIVE
"This use to be my FAVORITE app for music. However, for the past 2 weeks or so it's gone to the bottom of the list. It now glitches EVERY time I open the app when my music is playing through the car speakers. In order to get it to play again I have to restart my device I lose the song that I was listening to. This is completely unacceptable I pay for this app (I won't be next month if it's not fixed soon) I'm not using the free one.",NEGATIVE
I love music it's always been a passion for me before trying Spotify I had tried probably every music app that was available and none of them are anywhere close to being a great as Spotify it's easy to use great song selections great prices you just can't get any better than Spotify Thanks for such a great music app Spotify,POSITIVE

Perfection. Would be nice to see like a shazam feature in future updates Still Dope a featurevto Dm people with similar music taste would be ðŸ”¥,NEGATIVE
Why does Spotify not stop on incoming calls,POSITIVE
It's good music but sometimes it just plays random music that aren't in the play list but other than that it is a good music app,POSITIVE
In app ads is not cool for a paid app.,NEGATIVE
"Awful for the last two weeks!!! Premium user App has bad glitches, please fix ASAP! Screen freezes or goes blank. Can't skip to next song. When typing in search bar no letters appear. Playlist won't load. App works when it feels like it this is super frustrating for a music lover! On the verge of canceling and switching to Tidal this has never happened in the years I've had Spotify.",NEGATIVE
Excellent for a long way to get what you think about it and the service is very good at all times to the service you like on music even you think of not having in library you find out more information about Spotify music,POSITIVE
"So far so good ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, the Best of all music streaming app ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©",POSITIVE

Difficulty in opening acct and profile tabs in app.,NEGATIVE
I wish I didn't need to retype an artist everytime I add a song to a playlist. It gets annoying when youre not quite sure which version of the song you want or you want multiple songs from the same artist,NEGATIVE
"Lovely, enjoying music and very clear",POSITIVE
Spotify is always best for me,POSITIVE
"When I open the app and click the play button for Playing a song, the app has crashed. Annoying...",NEGATIVE
"It hasn't worked for the past two months, even after uninstalling it and downloading again. It shows albums and playlists, but every single one says it's empty. I gave it time to see if they would fix it, but two months of having no music on a music app is pathetic. Apparently it's a known issue for Androids and if reinstalling it doesn't work they say you're out of luck.",NEGATIVE
All the music i can and want to listen to.,POSITIVE
I love music and I like that I can I mean love that I can put it on loop and the best part is that I can still listen to it while I playing a game or something so I think it deserves â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† not like a â˜†â˜†â˜†,POSITIVE
It is perfect app because I got every song i want But in ganna i don't use to get,NEGATIVE

Sheesh!! Cool music and I love it!,POSITIVE
Too much ad!!! I will rather prefer reso..,NEGATIVE
"2.5 â­ (rounded down) On PC, Spotify is fantastic. Able to find songs and enjoy listening to them while doing work or relaxing. Ads on PC are acceptable while considering the Premium option. On Mobile, the experience polarising to say the least. You cannot play the song you wanted, limited skips per hour, and other features that makes me hesitate on the Premium offer. For those who are on PC, Spotify is a good choice. As a mobile app, rather stick to your media library or listening on YouTube.",POSITIVE
I love it I get to listen to all the podcast that come out with out issues.,POSITIVE
"I love this app . best thing is "" no advertising between listing songs"" â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",NEGATIVE
App updated yesterday (June 7) and now the app won't load and hangs... Was ok before,NEGATIVE
"Honestly, one of the worst UI for a major app. Always been terrible and probably will always be terrible.",NEGATIVE
"I have this app downloaded 100% to listen to Joe Rogan. However, I don't like clutter so when I initially switched I was fully planning on using it for all my podcasts and music so I could get rid of my Pocketcast and YouTube Music apps and consolidate thay into one. However, the podcast catcher is literally soooo unusable that it was impossible to have a seamless experience. With how many developers are surely on the Spotify team, I'd at least look at how other apps are doing it.",NEGATIVE
I use Spotify all the time on the motorcycle,NEGATIVE
"Please let us save unlimited offline songs, as a Music lover I highly recommend to lift the 10,000 song limit in the library. We want to enjoy streaming songs and play it offline infinitely. Hoping for the next update or in the future updates.",POSITIVE
Spotify went from songs not staying downloaded to becoming unresponsive and bricking my phone when it becomes stuck ðŸ™ƒ,NEGATIVE
I can't hear songs in mobile data please fix this issue,NEGATIVE
Great app to listen to any type of music,POSITIVE
"Best Music App. Love Spotify..... ""Playlist Chala, Spotify Sunte Ja""",POSITIVE
"Not working well with assistants recently Spotify isn't responding 90% of the time to assistants. Bixby, Bixby routines, Google Assistant on Samsung S22 and S20 Ultra nor Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 are opening and playing songs on the app properly anymore I have to constantly close and reopen, and even that doesn't seem to be fixing the issue most of the time anymore. I can't get it to work at all on the watch with my phone",NEGATIVE
"Please fix this app, why do I get only 6 skips per hour, and why does it always shuffle my songs when I try to listen to a playlist, and why can't I listen to a song before I put it in my playlist but I suppose spotify never listens the the reviews",NEGATIVE
"Lots of ads, very unhappyðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž",NEGATIVE
Collection of songs are good,POSITIVE
Had the worst experience with this app on my phone. Literally can't have the same feature I got on my computer. Can't play my selected song peacefully without dealing with automatically chosen song and suggested ones.,NEGATIVE
"I'v only come across this app and I can't get over the tunes I'm in to, I'm an old man from the 60s I can find everything I have asked for,. â˜®ï¸ Peace and love to all â¤ï¸",NEGATIVE
"Spotify the more more collection in tamil. And install Spotify premium ad-free , higher quality song play with lyrics for highest song's. This app more mind relaxation ðŸ˜Œ.",NEGATIVE
"The suggested song ""FeAtUrE"" completely destroys the experience. I can't listen to ANY of my Playlist without them being completely replaced with SuGgEsTeD songs. This feature is garbage. I used to live Spotify but this really sucks.",NEGATIVE
The app keeps doing this thing when a song is playing where I can no longer see the play/pause bar at the bottom of the screen. It disappears out of nowhere! I uninstall and reinstall the app then it works again. Very annoying!!,NEGATIVE
One of the best music app,POSITIVE
Can't imagine listening to music without Spotify anymore! Have discovered so many new artists thanks to the app,POSITIVE
"Again, this update is extremely glitchy. It will play music then the app will close or stop the music and when you open it again, it's like you haven't used it; the music doesn't start where it stopped and it will do this every couple songs. I have been paying for Spotify for a couple years now and I like this app when it works well. I don't plan to switch but this needs to be fixed, it's like every 2 updates it glitches so bad.",NEGATIVE
I can't play the music at all after the latest update,NEGATIVE
"I really love using Spotify, but lately whenever I open the app, it glitches/bugs and makes my phone restart, I don't know why that is happening but it's becoming annoying...",NEGATIVE
Somehow the music that we have downloaded onto our site is being hacked over by other music not cool guys.,NEGATIVE

Love how many song choices and options! Premium family is totally worth the money!!!,POSITIVE
Why i cannot payment for premium after upgrade apps,NEGATIVE
"Hellllooooo Spotify? When are you going to fix the disappearing ""now playing,"" button. I'm paying for a subscription but the app on Android is almost totally useless. Ridiculous that you haven't got this fixed yet.",NEGATIVE
Are you kidding me Spotify? This new update is horrible. What makes you think automatically shuffling our playlists is a good update. I want to listen to the songs in order. Why does it only show a few songs in a playlist and you have to click on it to see the entire playlist? Why can't I go back and listen to the previous song? These updates are not only useless but limiting us from properly listening to music. The purpose of a playlist is for US to add songs we WANT to listen to. Not the app!,NEGATIVE
Can not find a better music app.,NEGATIVE
Easy and joyful,POSITIVE
"Great app, just really enjoy the updated version. Easy to find music and podcasts to whatever is my fancy at that moment.",POSITIVE
"Normally it's great I've been using Spotify for probably 10 years now. The latest update (June 6 2022) made it so the music keeps stopping, so maybe a patch is in order",NEGATIVE
Randomized play is NOT randomized at all (in a playlist >1000 tracks). It weighes public popularity and already private played number of times in too and that is not what I want (nor is it sheer randomized). Lots of tracks inside the play list are not played at all ever this way.,NEGATIVE
I just love the fact that Spotify has all the music im into,POSITIVE
Best music apps out their that they should pay us for listening to music on it it's that good,POSITIVE
Login process has stopped,NEGATIVE
"there is a problem in my phone where i cant listen to music, im using the same account on my pc and phone but i cant listen to music on my phone. it shows me add songs only.",NEGATIVE

IT ALWAYS PICK ANY SONGS NOT MY FAV WHEN I PRESS MY FAV SONGS IT KEEPS PICKING RANDOM UGH IM JUST GOING TO DOWNLOAD PURETUBER YOU SUCK!,NEGATIVE
Found more of what I wanted to hear with Spotify than any other app.,POSITIVE
Like the app but the ui is like its set up by idiots can't even access a list of all songs by an artist I search so I can add to Playlist and I'm a premium member tidal is way better,NEGATIVE
"When I joined ,took out an A/P option I prefer to just buy a card every 3 months.Also I like the continuous play whilst at work, with genre selections.Always spot on to take a tangent to stuff I haven't heard,or heard in ages! Keep up the good work.Dave.",POSITIVE
The ability to enjoy such a spectacular variety of artists who are generally ignored by 'mainstream' media is wonderful!!,POSITIVE
"I love this app,use it all the time but I hate when spotify adds songs to my playlists. as someone who cant listen to anything that isnt in my playlists without having a meltdown. I would like if you could atleast be able to turn it off in settings.",NEGATIVE
"Doesn't work with Pioneer Head unit anymore. Since the update in Februrary, I'm unable to connect to my Pioneer head unit in van. Update: app updated 6/6 and still doesn't work.",NEGATIVE

I Enjoy the music and even commercials are good.,POSITIVE
"i rly like this app, i love spotify. it expands my music taste and I just love that. my only (very small) problem is that I think they removed the feature to preview songs when you're like adding them and when it's recommended. yea that's all, overall, nice app !",POSITIVE
"My app isn't opening for some reason, fix the bugs asap or I'll die for depression.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely top music app. Definitely the best!,POSITIVE

"M Ã±ot able to login pls help , they say, pls check internet connection but everything is clear from my side.",POSITIVE
Plays all my music and then some. Sounds very goog.,NEGATIVE
"I would like to EXIT Spotify to when I close the app. Instead it keeps playing in the background. I continually have to find the app, scroll thru 50 settings to exit the app. I understand why Spotify does that..... As long as the app is open, Spotify can see all your contacts, texts, Personal data, etc. Spotify, keep your nose out of my phone and exit the app when I say so, not when you want",NEGATIVE
I love the app ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° so easy to do find my favorite rappers with their best songs 1ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,POSITIVE

Honestly great app. algorithm needs some work tho. Songs I have put in don't play again still show up in my daily mixes. Why? I clearly don't to hear them so why still have them there? Just curious. Other than that great app.,NEGATIVE
Low bandwidth. Great Music.,POSITIVE

Lovely music of my choosing. No hiccups enjoyable listening,POSITIVE
"Spotify is the best, if you're a music lover I recommend you guiz to download this.",POSITIVE
All of my playlists disappeared after my phone updated. What the hell? It took me years to build those playlists. If I can't get them back I am canceling my subscription. Spotify has not been functioning the way it should for months and this is the last straw. I'm done.,NEGATIVE
"Needs more flexibilty on neing able to organize , and keep, music files in the order which user wants to.",NEGATIVE
I have been using this app for years and I haven't felt the need to look for another music app,NEGATIVE
one of the best free app there is. Would recommend it to any music lover who doesn't want to pay for a subscription.,POSITIVE
I have paid â‚¹129/- for one month one time premium today but the premium account hasn't been activated till now.,NEGATIVE
I really like this app as you can listen offline which is perfect for listening when you're out and about and don't want to bother people with your noise,POSITIVE
Awesome. The combination of good quality music is amazing in this app.,POSITIVE
"Best free music app out there. It even stands in the top 3 of the ones that charge a fee. For the complainers, if you think you can get better for free your wrong and you can't get better when you pay for one either. Even the most expensive ones have the same little issues because certain issues can't be fixed. Perfect signal and perfect play comes with perfect reception and it's where you live that determines that. If you want better, move to better reception areas. They're all the same.",POSITIVE
"I love the Playlists, would be better if quality of sound would be hi-fi at least. But overall great experience.",POSITIVE
"Well It plays music, you choose and it plays it.",POSITIVE

This is the great app i have ever scene â¤ï¸ i like it alot and i will also suggest you all to use it too ðŸ¤—,POSITIVE

"I get an ad every 2 minutes, the skips are limited and I cant listen to the songs I want to. Do I need to say more?",NEGATIVE
Look this is irritating. Sometimw the app just wont work. I want to listen i have data but spotify only shows me my downloaded playlist. Great but i dont want to listen to the same 20 songs. I want to listen to whatever i like thats the whole point of PREMIUM UPDATE yall pssing me off now nothing on Android?,NEGATIVE
It's been great! Literally every song is in here. Highly recommend it for everyone who enjoys listening to music as sloften as I do.,POSITIVE

"Recent update and my Playlists have disappeared! Unable to play anything!!!! Why am I paying for premium when I can't use it, sort it out please",NEGATIVE
"Wonderful, Excellent, marvelous, awesome, excitingly, creatively, generously.",POSITIVE
The music is really good and a great variety music from the twenties & thirties to the present. Yes some music recordings have been cut back but stills puts out a great volune varieties that makes spotify a very addictingand lovableby all means.,POSITIVE
The only thing I don't like about it is that every single time I want to play music it says I have no internet so I have to delete it and download it again I hate that that's why there's I'm not giving a five stars but other than that it's pretty good,POSITIVE
Wth i can't do anything if i didn't get the premium even skipping more than 6 song of repeat the same song anymore!!! It used to be good now I'm going to delete it and start downloading all the songs on my phone again,NEGATIVE
Excellent range of music and artists.,POSITIVE
"Pause and play banner disappears within Spotify app. Cannot turn off podcast or music except by closing app, which is ridiculous. Also, no simple option to play just one podcast, rather than being bombarded by countless episodes on an autoplay. Spotify seems to lack technical nous. Even Acast allowed only one episode to play without issue.",NEGATIVE
When I play song app automatically get close that is a rubbish thing I don't like it please do something I event can't play songs that's why I am giving one star rating fix that problem please,NEGATIVE
Worst.. So many albums were I finding since 3 years it was still corrupted.. Even if I contacted with spotify..,NEGATIVE
"Generally good, but local files are an absolute mess, they definitely need to get an update. Another thing that it's lacking in is more social features. Some big bugs and crashes occur quite often.",NEGATIVE
Why the near constant pop up for Bluetooth access??? Does the app not understand when denied once? Why do I give Bluetooth access when I am playing off of my phone speakers?? What nonsense is this? Maybe Spotify team needs to focus on making the song suggestion algorithm better instead of needlessly ruining the UI. Apple music is better.,NEGATIVE
"um what is going on? whenever i try to play a song it just jumps out?? it was working normally before but all of a sudden it turned into this. edit : im getting so mad it was working for a few days and then after the recent update, it went back, its beena few days and it has not been fixed.",NEGATIVE

I have a suggestion that other language songs should have english subs ... Like we can change the languages I will be helpful,NEGATIVE
"The queue function only works about half of the time. I add 5 songs to my queue, which all produce a pop up saying they were added to queue. I then go to my queue and it's empty... Then I do the exact same and it will work the second or third time. Also randomly decides to play on a mini loop within an album or playlist. Say the album is 15 songs in length. Instead of playing songs 1-15, gets to the 7th song, then goes back to song 1 and plays in a loop 1-7 until you manually select song 8.",NEGATIVE
It's good ðŸ‘ quality is amazing every song is available. As I am a Drama fan so i love that it also have OST. But I can't get lyrics of any song I know there aren't lyrics for every song but I can't get it on any song. Please help me. Thank you -Amazing App,POSITIVE
"Great app, but it has a lack of informations about the artists and songs.",NEGATIVE
Best music wide variety of any music to country like me to pop not my favorite to old gangsta rap which I like then just regular rap which I like to when I work out I can leastin to rock heavy rock to metal and heavy metal best music app you can get,POSITIVE
Just best music app for relaxing,POSITIVE
"Normally don't write reviews. However, my liked songs Playlist will literally play the same bout maybe just 30 songs out of the hundreds I literally have in a constant mini shuffle and will start over. I checked settings to see if there was a solution. I removed the app re downloaded. Deleted cache and app memory. Problem still ongoing. Real close to canceling and getting a new app for music",NEGATIVE
Spotify is nice to have it's good for the PS4 too,POSITIVE
So much ads ... Really I Am telling don't download this music app if you haven't taken the subscription ads will come after every 2 song ... And just swings the mood ðŸ¤¬,POSITIVE
Extremely amazing. And it can become more amazing if you add the song downloading option it this app so that we can enjoy our favourate songs whenever we want.,POSITIVE
Great music especially on the go.,POSITIVE
Sometimes when I'm ooffline it won't load my liked songs that I've downloaded at all :/,NEGATIVE
"Lately, every time I start listening to a song in one of my playlists, the stupid app decides that it's time to play my songs randomly. Shuffle play is automatically selected every time in every playlist. It's annoying.",NEGATIVE
Update - Spotify is back working fine! Old news - Been Subscribed to Spotify for a long time now but the latest update doesn't allow the app to work. Continuous to crash upon opening. Hoping for a solution soon. Thank you.,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify but uhh i can't see the full description of a playlist. Please fix,NEGATIVE
It's ok. My enhanced feature has never been restored. I am not going to make a new account. It's truly just ok.,POSITIVE
"Good app but doesnt have some songs ,, but it does have an easy navigation throughout the app and has alot of options too! It doesnt have most youtube videos/songs on youtube ? â—ðŸ’¯â¤ï¸",NEGATIVE
Went from 30 second advertisements to now THREE MINUTES before you can listen to music. Atrocious.,NEGATIVE
great application!!! don't miss to upload.,POSITIVE
Easy to use and great music choices.,POSITIVE
Never had a problem with Spotify. Love listening to podcasts on it.,POSITIVE
"Mine keeps stating ""no internet connection"", very annoying as I'd have to reset my phone everytime I want to stream music!",NEGATIVE
Too many ads .,NEGATIVE
Super the best music player with a large selection,POSITIVE
"Look, I get that apps need to make ad revenue to survive, but I just listened to 7 ads in a row to start listening to my playlist, SEVEN!!! If you're a glutton for ads, this is it for you.",NEGATIVE
"It's fine, I'm enjoying the music.",POSITIVE
Nice work Spotify,POSITIVE
"Except for the ads, everything is perfect",POSITIVE
"Love this app, gives me a wide variety of music genres and artists that I enjoy listening to.",POSITIVE
"This is so good experience about the other music but the problem is I'm going to spotify premium to free skip but I can skip when your going to continue to skip, the skip has been stop and the skip is available when after the 6 hour. But spotify its so important for me because spotify it's my door to get out for vecna's world. Joke heheðŸ˜…",NEGATIVE
Frequently have issues with the music library disappearing from the app and spotify have done nothing to remove the glitch. Only way to resolve the issue is remove app multiple times and hope one time the new install works!,NEGATIVE
Love this app! Has all the music I love and some I haven't thought about in years popped up!,POSITIVE
"My experience with Spotify has been pretty good over the past years, but since the removal of being able to preview songs when adding them to playlists the app hasn't been as enjoyable to use. I'm not sure why that feature was removed, as it seemed to be helpful to a lot of other people too.",NEGATIVE
You need premium to tern of shuffle but on xbox and laptops you dont,NEGATIVE
This app is very good for music than other apps but it doesn't feature lyrics for some english songs. They have to add fast.,POSITIVE
"Lately paying for premium doesn't seem worth it. Their app is awful. I've had issues with it randomly skipping songs, starts playing after I pause it in my car, and now it won't show the controls at the bottom. Several times today I had the issue of getting into my car and it say ""Spotify is trying to play"" while playing music, but the app wasn't open on my phone. If this continues I'm ending my subscription. Very unfortunate considering how long I've been a premium member.",NEGATIVE
It's really a 5 star app just don't want them to get big headed go head get the premium package best 10 you will ever spend,NEGATIVE
"I just wanted do a trial, but...... the ads after trial is over are beyond ridiculous. It also says that it will allow you to search a song after trial. But it doesn't let you look up a specific song once you're 2 weeks are up. It just send you to the artists albums. I barely used it during the 2 weeks. I'm very disappointed in the trial. I will not be purchasing. I'll just stick with YouTube Music.",NEGATIVE
Works great until it glitches and only plays ads with no songs,NEGATIVE
A very wide selection of music is available and the app is not complicated to use.,POSITIVE
Spotify is amazing on my chrome and laptop I listen to whatever music I want and I could skip or stop as many times as I want to but when I installed it on my phone it sucks I only get 6 skips an hour what the hell I just want to listen to my song in order sure it's nice to hear mix every once and while but when I want it in order at least let me have that.,NEGATIVE
"Premium is worth it. Might even have all the best songs, the sound quality is also really good.",POSITIVE
"I use spotify daily. There are a few problems. When creating a new playlist, if it isn't over 40 or so minutes long, it won't stop ""suggesting"" songs or playing random songs. I'm on the free version, and the ads played between songs, while bearable, are quite ridiculous. Sometimes, the songs just stop halfway through and start over when played again. Spotify is probably the best music app I've seen though, so I won't be leaving, but I do hope that these problems are taken care of.",NEGATIVE
"Great music ðŸŽ¶, and I will be listening ðŸŽ§ to it for a very long time.",POSITIVE
"It is very hard and aggravating to try to get into your personal playlist and pick the specific song you want to listen to. Maybe for the premium plan you can access it better, but I'm on the free plan. Also the ads are SUPER ANNOYING AND EXCESIVE. I do like the fact that I can listen to music without being on the actual app, so that is a big plus",NEGATIVE
Benn with them for ever now one of the best music app still. this is all I use when I'm at work or just to chill listening to some lofi taking a nap om the grass,POSITIVE
My playlist doesn't working. After first song of the playlist another random song start playing .,NEGATIVE
"Except the fact that there's no dislike button, been using it for at least a month now, and I can say that I've enjoyed every bit of it. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ But y'all should seriously try to implement the dislike button option aswell",NEGATIVE
Lyrics are not visible,NEGATIVE
Good. But too many adsðŸ˜”,NEGATIVE
"Love the quality of music, and the features are so comfortable that I always use only Spotify to listen musicðŸ’œ The premium plans are easily accessible and of reasonable price. I Love Spotify â£ï¸",POSITIVE
"This is a horrible app, its cuz it gives me the wrong songs! I open worlds smallest violin and it plays sun and moon!ðŸ˜¢ pls fix this i even try go to songs",NEGATIVE
It's very nice application to play our favorite track..... ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"I love this app so much, no Lag, easy to navigate, and 99% have the music I want",POSITIVE
I really enjoy Spotify. Best music premium app.,POSITIVE
Sound is really unbelievable,NEGATIVE
Love this app good choice of music and podcasts,POSITIVE
Love this app! Can find most of what I want on here.,POSITIVE
"the recommended songs just annoys me, i just wanna listen to the songs i have on the playlist yet it just plays different songs that isn't even in my playlist, there was this one song that wasn't even in my playlist yet it said it was in it, i checked the playlist and it wasn't even there. This update just sucks not gonna lie",NEGATIVE
"Today, I wanted to listen to one of my playlists. When I started the shuffle, I was greeted with a suggested song not on the playlist. I skipped it, and got a song on the playlist. When the song ended, up got another suggested song. Skip. Song on the playlist. Song ends. Yet another suggested song. Skip. Suggested song. Skip. Suggested song. Why would you give me more suggested songs than those on the playlist? I don't know what you're testing, but you need to cut it out.",NEGATIVE
Loved this app. However I will appreciate being able to sample songs when setting up playlists again. This function hasn't been active in the recent updates.,NEGATIVE
I am a music lover and the experience of the spotify is very amazing because music is my world literally thx for making this kind of app for the music lovers,POSITIVE
Ads suck...but with premium its the best music app out there,POSITIVE
"Whenever I connect to my home wifi the app shows no internet available. It's really frustrating, like I'm writing this review using the same wifi but not able to search anything. I can play the songs from my liked playlist which I have not downloaded but cannot search new songs. Don't know what this is but please fix it.",NEGATIVE
Entirely better than YouTube music for sure. Less annoying ads and you can listen while using another app.âœŒï¸ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
I love this music app. It's well worth the money each month to be able to enjoy endless music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ,POSITIVE
"Litterally horrible. If you're broke, or just don't want to pay for premium, it plays either twelve ads in a row on some days, and three ads after every song on other days. Not to mention how if you have a large playlist it'll only rotate around the same ten songs over and over again. Would never recommend",NEGATIVE
After listening to some HI-FI streaming services I will be canceling Spotify Premium soon. The sound quality is night and day. I almost feel cheated I didn't know about HI-FI. Get it together Spotify and I might be back....we'll see.,NEGATIVE
Everything is great but advertisements. Why is it so frequent? It's so annoying.,NEGATIVE
Not able to log in from couple of days.. Anyone at spotify care to sort this issue out?,NEGATIVE
Spotify works wondefuly on tablet and laptop is let's you skip as long as you want even without premium sure there might be some ads but you can always get used to it. With Spotify I spend most of my time just listening to music,POSITIVE
"Third class as. As when you click on a like song, Spotify removing sogs and try to force to buy premium membership. Useless app now.",NEGATIVE
Best app I have came across. I recommend this to all music lovers,POSITIVE
I have to restart the app every time I get a phone call and it will randomly lose my place in the podcast start me from the beginning and play all the ads again. Good for music s*** for podcasts,NEGATIVE
I hate that Spotify automatically starts playing when connected to Android auto.,NEGATIVE
Allways be with me ..... When my mood changes into happy and sadness ðŸ˜œðŸ˜Š... Very good app must install to listens lovely songs ....,POSITIVE
My spotify not showing songs + playlist I can't able to listen songs,NEGATIVE
"I have Android Auto and the Google Assistant in my vehicle. When I request ""It Hasn't Hit Me Yet"" by Blue Rodeo Spotufy won'tplay it for me?Please rectify this for me. Thank you very much.",POSITIVE
Spotify: Music and Podtcasts,NEGATIVE
"Excellent platform if you want to educate yourself and learn , even about what the tech dynasty and their tyrants spend incredible time hiding from the public.",POSITIVE
A bit buggy but it's still rad Pay your artist Spotify,NEGATIVE
"Heyy, this as is not at all working fine!! The thing is, it shows that I'm offline even when my internet connection is at its highest...I decided to try logging out and then logging in again, but it still shows that there is some network error, and now I'm not able to loggin again! This is baadddddd... Please fix this..!",NEGATIVE
"Spotify doesnt play the whole song most people complained.. I cleared cachae, data, and uninstalled it...it didnt work..im getting a better appðŸ¤ªðŸ¤žðŸ¤‘",NEGATIVE
For someone not super experienced at new phones this was pretty easyâ¤ï¸,NEGATIVE
They can't let you swipe to queue a song that'd be too easy to use right? This is the gold standard for music apps but it's noticably worse than the iOS app.,NEGATIVE
"Good, I like the lyrics",POSITIVE
Pretty good. No glitches so far. By far best music app I've tried so far.,POSITIVE
Best music app on the market!!,POSITIVE
YouTube music has better songs and the radio station you choose stays in the right lane.,NEGATIVE
I used to love this app and could deal with ads. But now with the update or whatever I can't listen to just one song no it has to be shuffled with songs I don't want to hear. And yesterday when I was trying to skip one song (I didn't use any of skips that hour) It wouldn't let me skip and kept saying I discovered a premium feature. I used to want to recommend it friends but I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,POSITIVE
Love Spotify and the extras like podcasts.,NEGATIVE
one of the best music and podcasts app ever! it's very simple and easy to use.,POSITIVE
Love to hear the type of music I enjoy and not have to endure certain other types that you get on regular programming.,POSITIVE
Very good listening experience,POSITIVE
My Daily Mix is the best and helps me get through the day,POSITIVE
It's ok but it's getting expensive and it is literally useless if you do not have a high speed internet connection. It's better to put it on airplane mode than dare drop below perfect signal,NEGATIVE
Great app 10 out of 10 not a bot I swear,NEGATIVE
Never works properly. Unable to pause or even let a song/podcast play. Have had issues and developers get back to me with no working solution. Have to update every 2 days. They won't even offer me a discount. This is why Monopolies are illegal. Samsung Z Flip 3. Stuck with them I guessðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
"30 minutes it's a lie, and it doesn't work always",NEGATIVE
"I got rid of the paid account, and thought the ad supported one would be fine. But often I get as many ads as I do songs. I expect some, but it's way too much. Tonight I wanted to listen to a specific album, and every other song was something not only not from that album, but a wholly different musical genre. I'll stick with Amazon music.",NEGATIVE
"I love this app, I listen to music all the time. I like the usual songs but I also like discovering new artists and spotify makes that easy for me.",POSITIVE
"Says ""no internet connection"" ONLY on my favourite playlist ðŸ˜£ Phone is connected and all internet apps functional.",NEGATIVE
I have one account but I have been charged for 2 I just wish someone would respond back,NEGATIVE
"Used to enjoy this app, till the recent update. It's all bad, except the snippet feature. Can't even select an individual song and if I press shuffle again it just plays the song that's playing from the first time I shuffled. The useful features been removed so I have to play through a whole song or repeatedly skip through songs to get to the song I want to listen to. I can't even rewind a song that's currently playing, there's no que feature either. And there's more which I can't fit.",NEGATIVE
Everything else is great but I add trippie red to my Playlist and it doesn't add/play which is weird but everything else is fine,POSITIVE
"Lying about Offline Mode for Pro Subscribers. UNRELIABLE. I've found that unless you are actively keeping this app updated, offline mode for downloaded music and podcasts will not work. I've had multiple times where I would be on a flight or a multi hour drive through no cell service and find Spotify unusable despite having my playlists downloaded. It doesn't help that Spotify releases useless, spammy updates every other day. If this issue isnt fixed, I'm canceling. Stop punishing your pro user",NEGATIVE
It's not a good app I gave it one Star because it works on the first day also like no skips and they add stuff you don't want,NEGATIVE
"Really bad offline experience. If I go offline then I open the app to play musi c I've already downloaded, the app just hangs when trying to find it. Likewise, if I'm watching a podcast, and then for some reason the video cuts out, I can never get it back. Please improve the transition from online to offline and back again, this is very common for commuters going underground",NEGATIVE
Great service. I've found so many 8 bands by using the 'other songs like this' options.,POSITIVE
Something is wrong i can't play anything on my Spotify account i have premium family and all my playlists are empty i can add songs but they dont show up I try to play my liked songs and it just something went wrong I tried reinstalling and I tried logging out and back in I restarted my tablet i tried setting up a new account but its the same thing please fix I dont like any other music app,NEGATIVE
Getting msg since last update that I am offline when I am not. App now useless and I pay for premium service,NEGATIVE
It's been difficult to make payment on your platform from Nigeria. Kindly may available other mode of payment. Thank you!!!,NEGATIVE
Unique and surprising,POSITIVE
My play button and previous/next buttons are all messed up after One of the recent updates. The pause/play button is all the way to the right with the back/next buttons pushed all the way to the left. Ugly and a little unsettling.,NEGATIVE
What can I say. This app is awesome. Great music and great podcasts. Love it!,POSITIVE
Excellent with all forms of software..phone and Bluetooth excelent...regular information superb,POSITIVE
Osum Spotify love you yar thanks for develop.,POSITIVE
Great and easy to use. Only complaint is that on phone Spotify is much worse then on computer or another device similar to that.,NEGATIVE
Broken and unstable on latest Android version. Does not function.,NEGATIVE
"Crashes all the time, shuffle sucks, too many stupid features/bugs, downloaded songs won't play in airplane mode",NEGATIVE
Playing five ads in a row every few songs just ain't it,NEGATIVE
The only problem I have had was that sometimes I would play a song and a random song would start playing. But overall it's very fun and useful especially because you can exit the app and still hear the music unless your on an app that uses audio. Great app definitely recommend,POSITIVE
"For a music streaming service, they really want to sell podcasts. Super annoying and no way to turn them off.",NEGATIVE
Very reliable and great interface love it.,POSITIVE
"Premium is worth buying, Spotify - music soinds better with you... ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶",POSITIVE
Bluetooth constantly cuts out with this app now. I've gone through every possible bit of troubleshooting. This is the app that does this. Fix it.,NEGATIVE
Fuming that the play/pause bar keeps disappearing and I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I pay premium this is rubbish. Is there a way to solve this? I'm on S20 FE,NEGATIVE
I never give 5 stars unless something totally amazing happens .But close,POSITIVE
"You have too many ads, and your free trial isn't free. You have to have a credit card to take advantage of it.",NEGATIVE
Love It!! I listen every single day. Whatever mood I'm in I can find what I want to hear and it's easy and reliable!,POSITIVE
"Can podcasts ""My Episodes"" be sorted by released, newest to oldest?",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a really great application, but sometimes it just can't compare to using an adblocker while watching Youtube. Definitely consider trying to minimize ads, and what you do advertise, think twice how useful your advertisements are to the listener.",NEGATIVE
"3 stars, would be 4 or more if they just implemented Spotify hifi. Is that too much to ask?",NEGATIVE
Couldn't play request songs.. Also I couldn't unsubscribe till the first payment was made..I never used spotify cause its to complicating,NEGATIVE
"Free version sucks. It makes sense if I should pay to be able to download songs for offline listening, but the basics like previewing songs are not there? Moreover, only 6 skips an hour when I couldn't even choose the tracks I want because you keep adding tracks I don't want to hear in the first place. If you really want people to pay for premium, don't make it because the free version is super inconvenient. At this rate, the minute a competitor appears, people would just jump ship immediately.",NEGATIVE
Great app for when you're doing work or need to relax.ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
I pay for premium and yet i still receive pop ups and voting polls. I may not have ad interpretations and I may be able to skip as many songs as I like but for Â£10 a month this is unacceptable,NEGATIVE
Canvas Video not Working in India. Many International Songs Not Available to play in India. very Expensive compared to Rivals. Also Where is Spotify HIFi,NEGATIVE
"Love this app ,lots of genres of music ,great sounds",POSITIVE
"This app is still buggy for android and even more so on the galaxy watch 4, You can download music to the watch but it never stays, after the music is downloaded the Playlist is erased and starts downloading all over again (instantly). It also takes up too much space especially since it's supposed to be proprietary to the galaxy watch.",NEGATIVE
"I love that it plays without have to burn through my battery life, and i can listen to it with my screen off",POSITIVE
This app remembers that music I like and makes playlists from it and changes it frequently...love that,POSITIVE
It is easy to find the song that I want. But one thing that makes me mad is random songs come in my playlist and it is annoying.,NEGATIVE
"Takes a while to open but once connected, music selections are great",POSITIVE
"great app, needs an update tho it completely takes off what I'm listening to, and kicks me off at times",NEGATIVE
I updated this rating because all the problems that I had were fixed,NEGATIVE
"Missing features that are small, specifically customization in settings. But it's manageable, and still good",POSITIVE
Can't pick your songs if you don't pay. May as well use YouTube music if I have to head ads. At least I can choose my songs.,NEGATIVE
"It has music, which is nice. But premium is way too expensive for me, and the ads are broken. It will ask you if you want to watch an ad for an 'uninterrupted 30 minutes' and will play ads whether or not you agree, and then about 10 minutes worth of music it will give you another ad anyways. Not to mention how incredibly laggy the app is, I can't even tell what song is playing. And forgot using the app while it serves you three 30 second long ads in a row. Miserable experience.",NEGATIVE
Well its good and all but when i try tobplay a song it plays a hole diff song so yeahðŸ˜¶,NEGATIVE
"Overall...Meh. Selection and audio quality is pretty good but the navigation is horrible. Same goes for Android Auto version. Way too many taps to get to common areas. Also, it's integration with Google speakers is less than desirable.",NEGATIVE
A really good app to play You get to play your favourite songs,POSITIVE
I hate how recently a lot of songs loose their lyrics on here after the recent updates? anyone else hate this?,NEGATIVE
I use Spotify on my daily basis......i really love this app....it keeps me always in a mood :),POSITIVE
Spotify..... Kinda sucks. that's it here's why you can't look up specific songs. and when you do you get a playlist named after that song. Runes the app,NEGATIVE
I can't select what song to listen and only 6 skips per hour that's annoying please chang that,NEGATIVE
"Great! Love the fact that you can search up famous musicians from the 70's! You can even like how many songs you would hear over, and over again! My sister has over 400+ songs in her like list. She is still trying to pick more songs to like, and more songs to here. Great app, and I love it, so much. One more thing is that if you don't pay premium, you can still shut off your phone. Great job, Spotify! ðŸ¤Ÿ",POSITIVE
Great music app works good for me.,POSITIVE
I'm installing this app because of Munawar Faruqui. Today Halki halki si barsat song has been uploaded in spotify app.,NEGATIVE
Waw this good app I found all song i want to play it,POSITIVE
So delighted about the app and it gives you the chance to listen to almost all the songs in world ðŸŒŽ ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘ I will use this app always â¤,POSITIVE
everything was good until the new update i cant even download my songs just because i wasn't on premium and i cant skip songs i can only skip 6 songs per hour,NEGATIVE
Well I would like to say so far so good so much better than Amazon music unlimited and cheaper. At least you're an honest app that gives full new CDs of music that you promise. Much more music and information so far I'm very happy with this will keep you updated thank you much ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ˜Ž,POSITIVE
"It's good,and has alot of songs,though I can't seem to figure out if I can loop songs,if I can't then what's the point in using it?",POSITIVE
Always a good mix. Very reasonable ads for such a great service!,POSITIVE
"I cant even play the songs i want, i have a playlist with like, , maybe 8 songs? Whenever i play it, none of the songs in the playlist actually come up. Just random songs that I've never heard of and arent my prefered type of music. I cant even delete the random ones that do. Whats the point of Choosing songs if your gonna give me ones that i definitely did NOT choose nor want?",NEGATIVE
Spotify is spot on for music lovers. The collection is thoughtful and the interface is friendly. An app that makes your feet tap.,POSITIVE
I love it for music and podcasts,POSITIVE
"The songs that I choose are entirely different, when I click the song I want to play it plays a different song but it still has the album cover with the play button but the song playing is different, hope you can fix this",POSITIVE
What's up with the ads? I've been using this app for ages and just suddenly I am getting 2-3 ads for every 2-3 songs. It's crazy!,NEGATIVE
The UI is worsening with each update. The app feels slow. The semi-transparent titlebar at the bottom of the screen looks horrible. The artist image in artist pages often cut out the face of the artist for older artists. It doesn't even fetch the actual image sometimes - just loads a random album cover instead of it (although works in the desktop version).,NEGATIVE
Mad Great. Just didn't give a full 5Star cos I would love for them to surprise me more ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤—,NEGATIVE
Very annoying. When you wanna play a song it gives you a random song and plays that instead of the song i want it to play. It completely removes the entire point of the app.,NEGATIVE
"One big reason to love this app is that you can be listening to Spotify music and send text messages, play games. It will continue to play while doing other things. Spotify has tons of music to chose from, different genres and a almost endless list of artist. This app has gotten better and better. The concerts, special sales for merchandise from your favorite musicians and the all extras that are to many to list. Love it still!!",POSITIVE
so now we cant even listen to the song we want to play unless we upgrade to premium. just great,POSITIVE
"Its really good, but the ads are way too much also there is no translation for all kpop songs ....there are not all idols and singers on it....IMPROVE IT ......ITS IRRITATING",NEGATIVE
Hands down the best way to listen to music absolutely love this app,POSITIVE
"Your loss... I tried to buy the premium package but Spotify kept telling me my card wasn't valid, even though my card is and there is a tiny bit of money in my bank account... That's ok because YouTube music account set up now.",POSITIVE
Works great. Only had a couple glitches,NEGATIVE
"First the Car Thing, and now Spotify Voice. Two features that would be extremely useful for UK and other European users (especially for the UK given recent changes to our law) that are completely unavailable to people outside of the US. Why are we treated less importantly than those in the US and given less features? We all pay the subscription fee, it's ridiculous that they get more functionality for their money.",NEGATIVE
Songs good quality enjoy the beat tq team Spotify.but ads playing more than songs,POSITIVE
Fantastic music app with variety of songs collection. Really loved and enjoying it daily.,POSITIVE
ADS TO MANY ADS AND STOP ADDING SONG TO MY PLAYLIST,NEGATIVE
I like the fact that ever song I've looked up was found .,POSITIVE
the premium student haha. they only choose the rich kids uni/college. my college are not even on the list,NEGATIVE
"I can't access the premium account using mobile device,........",NEGATIVE
The best music app.,POSITIVE
I love Spotify. The fact that I can sing along with Lyrics is everything.,POSITIVE
Spotify is an awesome app. It's meets my expecting greatly and the way everything is organized so I can find things easily is so nice. 10/10 rating for sure.,POSITIVE
Great app for the entire family!,POSITIVE
This app is really good for music it has a ton of songs on it but I'm the adds are kinda annoying but over all it's a good app,POSITIVE
"I can listen to any song I want. No adds. I can make my own playlists and it just cycles through the songs even when my phone screen is off. Very convenient. And while there are some songs I with were on there, that's no fault of Spotify's, that's just the person never put it on there. This is by far the best way to listen to music and even podcasts in my opinion. :)",POSITIVE
1 start less because of too much add and 1 for not download system ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,NEGATIVE
"Excellent it has all the music I want ,very affordable price.",POSITIVE
Overall it's good I just don't like you have to click on each song while viewing new releases,POSITIVE
"The feature to share on other devices is becoming quite annoying. I live in flats with shared wifi, and there is constantly a pop up asking if I want to connect to someone else's device. It's annoying if I accidentally click that. Can there please be a way to turn this feature off.",NEGATIVE
"So far the was really good...but after the recent update it keeps crashing. I have tried all the possible methods (uninstalling-reinstalling, clearing cache, updating os etc). But nothing is working. I don't know why it is crashing in Android 12 ver but working fine in 11th vers ...",NEGATIVE
"Third class application. Even after connected to wifi it showing no internet connection. Spotify, please improve application instead of adding ads. Such loose marketing it is.",NEGATIVE
The app just close on its own whenever I press play. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE
It was great at the beginning but then it kept adding songs into my playlists and I couldn't get rid of it. It got to the point of not even playing the songs in the playlist.,NEGATIVE
Easily my favorite streaming app! I use it constantly and am never disappointed!,POSITIVE
Very good play songs,POSITIVE
"So good for music and other things, yes there are ads, but theres also spotify premium.ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰",POSITIVE
"App is Great, get to see whats new in My Genre. Fully customizable playlist for the avid user.",POSITIVE
Easy to use. Lots if good music,NEGATIVE
Can't live without Spotify!,POSITIVE
Everything was going good until the new update. Its kinda unfair how I cant preview (listen) the songs before I add them anymore. I just wish it was like before.,NEGATIVE
One of the best song app,POSITIVE
I love the app it's def all in 1 all around listening magic machine,POSITIVE
"AMAZING APP!! All the music you want to listen to is here!! Best music app so far. I got no trouble or problems with this app. Before you install it, there's also ADs but not many!! :) 10/10.",POSITIVE
Totally recommended for music lovers and artists,POSITIVE
"Buggy, The mobile app crashes and won't display downloaded episodes when you don't have service which is the whole point of downloaded episodes. I use the app on my Chromebook and it skips all the time if you have any other web pages open",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming I've ever used ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,POSITIVE
"Great algorithm! Recommendations are really great and sound quality is amazing but lately I've been facing some problems regarding connectivity. It shows ""I'm not connected to Internet"" whereas all other apps work perfectly... idk what to do but... Spotify Lite solves the problem",NEGATIVE
Everything thing is perfect but ads ðŸ˜…,POSITIVE
It's good the ads aren't too long,POSITIVE
Been exceptional once. But now you'll gett advertise after every song instead of every 30 min. On free version.,NEGATIVE
Unstable ui in Android,NEGATIVE
"Literally the best app for listening songs.The features are all well made and very comfortable to use.Only concern is, some of my favourites doesn't have the lyrics even if it's years old. Like ""Night changes"".",POSITIVE
"Amazing app, best for listening to music.",POSITIVE
Such a good platform of music.,POSITIVE
Can always count on Spotify to find accompaniment tracs!!!,NEGATIVE
Great app but advert after almost every song unless you sign up for premium which unfortunately I am not in a position to pay for that ATM due to financial issues ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜–ðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
Just an overall great music player filled with tens of thousands songs and artists to choose from and hey the free version is great as well so what if you have a 30 sec commercial cause after that then you got half an hour of un interrupted music. 5 ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Oh did I mention you get 6 free skips .. yes I think better than pandora,POSITIVE
Like... when im playing certain songs they play but when I try to play another certain song it plays another song!!!! Why is it like that!??!?!?!??!?!,NEGATIVE
"I deleted spotify and downloaded it again approx. 2 weeks back and I haven't been log in to my account ever since then. 1) No there is no server or network issue at my end. 2) I was able to log in on the web version of spotify in opera browser in my laptop which means the issue is in the app. 3) I have tried changing my password, using OTP and even direct link that I got in my email but all were unsuccessful and everytime it throwed an error. Please look into it and reply.",NEGATIVE
"We love Spotify , it is wonderful",POSITIVE
Very good but only one problem the ads ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¥´,NEGATIVE
Amazing thanks so much for your special application ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
"I bought premium and my downloaded videos won't play,",NEGATIVE
Great music and app is working well with my alexa,POSITIVE
Everything is osm but from 2 days I can't play songs on it coz everytime I open it and play a song the app gets close on its own... Plzz help!,NEGATIVE
Need to stop play button,NEGATIVE
Work and go ads aren't to bad or long,POSITIVE
Actually this is a good app for everyone but I hope iphone users and android users doesn't have different features. I hope android users can also have the background sound features.,POSITIVE
"I absolutely LOVE this app!!! I always used Youtube but, I'm SO thankful I discovered Spotify! I'll NEVER go back.",POSITIVE
"Better than apple music , one of the best music app ever listened to",POSITIVE
"I can't even get to my playlists. And when I do, I can't go to the playlist and do what I want. The playlist only lets me play random and i can no longer preview songs. You let me down, Spotify.",NEGATIVE
"The free version is useless. It only made me aggressive. The app doesn't remember that it already played the ""once every 30 min"" ad. And bombards me with ads. Never bringing this trash to the gym again. I rather bring a power bank. Useless and very much overhyped.",NEGATIVE
This app is very amazingðŸ¤©. Whenever I am bored I listen songs from this app. I just love this app,POSITIVE
Great Playlist an affordable prices,POSITIVE
Has been super glitchy and slow in the last month. Considering cancelling my subscription for pandora,NEGATIVE
"I used to be fine with it on phone because i thought maybe it was hard to program being able to select single songs and rewind and stuff, and that xbox got those features because they have a deal with microsoft or something, but now when i was on my phone and xbox at the same time i learned that phone does have all the features to rewind and go back to last song, you just cant get those features unless youre on an xbox at the same time (or probably have premium), which makes no sense",NEGATIVE
"One of my favorite apps! All the music I love and I can make as many playlists as I want. Any artist, any song, you can find it. Highly recommend to anyone who loves music!",POSITIVE
It's awesome to lessen all my musics But in free version Try too increase volume. When I'm traveling to clg I love to lessen music but the outdoor sound are distributing due to low volume. So please Spotify consider this thankyou,NEGATIVE
"The app shuts down as soon as I play a song. It all started with the previous version of Spotify. I even talked to your support team and they told to wait for the latest update. I updated the app and the issue was gone for a few days. Now, I am facing the same issue again and I have tried everything I was told before. I reinstalled the app, tried to login my a/c in different devices but still no luck even after running the latest version of the app",NEGATIVE
"I have the premium plan and I can't get the app to play today at all. I've cleared the cache. I've Uninstalled added it back, nothing. It has been acting wonky lately. I'd hate to give it up for Apple music but I can't go on like this. ðŸ˜”",NEGATIVE
Constantly crashing when I try to listen to any podcast. Music works fine.,POSITIVE
Spotify has best podcasts and I like the format better than most platforms.,POSITIVE
There is no customer service number an ld the app is not working...there are no customer support...if you guys charge for premium membership shouldn't it be your responsibility to have a customer support team,NEGATIVE
Spotify is my favorite music,POSITIVE
Apk mod doesn't work anymore i guess I'll pay to Spotify again:(,NEGATIVE
"Too many advertisements, it spoils the vibe",NEGATIVE
Every song is available in this app best music app,POSITIVE
"Doesn't work as well on an Android (it was far better looking and more functional on my mother's iphone), but it is nice nonetheless. I was able to take a 3 month free trial which has already made it better for me, so I do not have any major complaints. I would just recommend fixing the functions when installed without the Premium deal on an Android.",POSITIVE
Unfortunately I've been unable to play any songs since last week! Podcasts are fine though.,POSITIVE
Excellent music selections. I love my gym jams Playlist,POSITIVE
It's a wonderful app I really love it Spotify is best forever really â¤â¤â¤,POSITIVE
"I hate the interface. I can't organize the feed so that what I WANT to see/hear is easily accessible, I end up with a bunch of 'recommended' stuff I don't want. I listen to one podcast; I shouldn't have to 'search' for it.",POSITIVE
"Don't know what happened with this app. Used to work fine. Now it constantly uses mobile data even if it's turned off in settings. Sometimes play lists (song radios) are being modified every 3 songs (download whole playlisty, play 3 songs, playlist is modified, requiring 60% of songs to be downloaded to play)",NEGATIVE
The Spotify has many songs it was melody etc,POSITIVE
"Discover weekly give bad music, for the most part. The rest is awesome",POSITIVE
"An easy 5/5 for me, I hope one day you can add music videos to the list tooðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
No method of playing songs from all the followed artists (shuffle artists),NEGATIVE
"Best streaming library, worst UI. Been hopping the last year or so between all the big services and I've landed back here. I'm still disgusted at this interface. Nothing about this is intuitive. I miss the old ui. The AI sucks. If it weren't for the fact that Spotify has wormed its way into integrating with EVERYTHING, I would not use it. Wish I could turn podcasts off.",NEGATIVE
Wonderful and relaxing entertainment,POSITIVE
My most used app! Love it. Such great value for all the family. Use it for music and podcasts almost daily.,POSITIVE
Good music selection...,POSITIVE
Can't play music can't download,NEGATIVE
"after the latest updates the app crashes immediately after I open the app and try to play something, tried reinstalling an it didn't help, impossible to play anything from spotify on my phone now",NEGATIVE
"Absolute garbage. Hassle to log in to. Plus, you can't even toggle shuffle off without having to pay money. Uninstalled",NEGATIVE
"Great but the ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" isn't 30 min, it's like 20.",NEGATIVE
"I have a xiaomi redmi note 10 pro and lyrics on the app don t show no matter what. did a clean reinstall according to their article, changed my phone s language to english, googled many many times for at least half a year. I am paying for spotify premium but honestly, not having lyrics on mobile and not having a sleep timer on pc are kind of dealbreakers, and I am open to move to another music app and not pay money for an ""indie company"" with missing/broken features for such a long time.",NEGATIVE
It is showing network connection error whenever I open the app or try to login Iam unable to play songs can you suggest me Something to solve this problem,NEGATIVE
Not a very good app unless you can pay for a monthly subscription.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is worst music app to many adds,NEGATIVE
My ðŸ’¯ for sure go to application for all my streaming of music & podcasts !! Thank you Spotify ðŸ’— Y'all got audiobooks too .. sheet ðŸ™ƒ,NEGATIVE
"Original 2021: It's always been and still is very buggy. Update 2022: Still buggy. If i switch to Apple, bye bye Spotify. I'm surprised at how much worse they keep making this app. They clearly have a huge backlog of technical debt and moreover are constantly conducting multivariate testing meaning large chunks of users get totally different experiences. Anyhow, I think the key thing to remember is to do your main task well (play music without sudden starts, stops, and Bluetooth failures).",NEGATIVE
Great using spotify. Enjoy listening to all my fave music,POSITIVE
One of the only apps left that can play local files well without pop up ads.,NEGATIVE
This is very good app Spotify hindi song telugu tamil wow,POSITIVE
"The app was good so far. But suddenly after the last update, the app keeps crashing whenever I'm trying to play anything making both the app and my subscription useless.",NEGATIVE
I just want to say that the Spotify is slowly removing few Mashups and remix songs so pls I would request to bring those songs back.,NEGATIVE
"If you change setting, it won't let you forget. It has to show the the message every time you use the app. As if it would change from the last time I used the app. If you bring it to their attention they just tell you that you have to have it the way they want or pound sand.",NEGATIVE
"I'm about ready to cancel my Spotify account. Really getting fed up with the working one day, not working the next or it just shuts down. Today, I couldn't listen to any of my music while offline. I uninstalled the app, reinstalled & rebooted the phone but it still didn't work. Now that I'm home, I find I have to download all my playlists yet again. I pay for premium service, but don't get it. Not such a premium app.",NEGATIVE
"I recomend using spotify on your computer because it has less adds and, lets you skip to what ever song you want without listing to other songs first. I also get better signal on my phone.",NEGATIVE
Great Music App of all time,POSITIVE
I love this for listening music in high quality,POSITIVE
"I love it but if u need to fast forward,more than the stipulated,it wn't allow",NEGATIVE
What's not to love? Can find any band or artist I look up. I really like everything about this app.,POSITIVE
Issue resolved!!! Thank you Team âœŒï¸,POSITIVE
Do glad I subscribed for this my mental state got way better ... Hello Spotify won't it be cool is I can just play random musics like shuffle musics without choosing a category,NEGATIVE
Xcellent..best besty..u have covered all except videos,POSITIVE
"Not big on spotify but it's not too bad. Not as intuitive to navigate through as others and it's probably that, that means it's not my go to music app. My main one I find has all the same music, possibly even more, but is just easier to use.",NEGATIVE
U can't turn shuffle off of like song playlist,POSITIVE
Hi uhm... Spotify app is really good although the offline button does not work for me please make it work in on Android btw,POSITIVE
App not working I literally cannot open this app and have to uninstall and reinstall it again and its bad don't know why??,NEGATIVE
"Update June 7: still happening. - I have to clean the cache for a song to work. One, the apps both here and pc are terrible. Slow and super heavy. No, I do not want to cache anything for optimum use. 5gb of cache daily? Really? If I wanted music downloaded, I'd do that myself. Two, Joe Rogan. The only thing that keeps me here is the work I had with my playlists. When I find a solution to this, goodbye.",NEGATIVE
I have premium subscription but I don't know why each song I played keeps on skipping and jumping for no reason as if I'm playing the song through CD Player in a bumpy road.,NEGATIVE
I have used the Spotify app for many years now and I enjoy the price as well as the selection of music and podcasts!,POSITIVE
"Just started wit Spotify, but like it very much, it's easy to use.",POSITIVE
I like it but I think we should be able to skip as many songs as we want without premium and we should choose our song and mabye not add songs,NEGATIVE
Spotify I'd great and all but recently for some reason I can't listen offline even tho I've downloaded a playlist,NEGATIVE
Why the hell songs get removed from my liked songs list...it gets so annoting please fix it,NEGATIVE
Love to listen on dis app..ðŸ˜ƒ And de lyrics r also dere so easy to learn also if any competition is held for singing.... Loved it... But de thing is tat dere are many many ads if we've not in the premium... Else everything good enough for dis app as it is to listen songs...

"Really good , crashes sometimes",POSITIVE
what the hell is with this connect feature??? im connected to a device on the same wifi and now i cant play my own music?? this is ridiculous!,NEGATIVE
"""Premium"" user experience: -You can't block your followers and spotify is refusing to add this feature FOR 10 YEARS. -UI is horrible and it gets worse with EVERY update. Screens are bigger and bigger and it's hard to reach top of the screen with one hand. What spotify is doing? They move important things to the top of the screen. -Also you can't customize anything. -External equalizers don't work properly - Search bar randomly stops working",NEGATIVE
"I'm a premium subscriber but I find the user interface rather clunky. I also don't like the occasional pop-up at launch asking me to upgrade...you have my email address for that Spotify! They've recently changed the in-car feature which has now rendered it useless in my car, as it now only caters for something called ""car thing"". The shuffle feature randomly kicks in with no instruction from the user. I'm paying for a service and don't feel like it's being provided.",NEGATIVE
Yeh app is very good every song you get. Personally this app is very good to me,POSITIVE
"Blocking a song in 1 list, now actually blocks it everywhere. Its terrible, fix it please.",NEGATIVE
"It's called playlist for a reason, don't play a random song that's not even in my playlist.",NEGATIVE
"The ""Added to liked songs"" button stops functioning at intervals",NEGATIVE
What the hell is this new update it's abosulty awful. The UI is confusing I cannot even listen to a specific song.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify has become super glitchy. I'm a paid member and I've been CONSTANTLY and CONSISTENTLY having issues. The player at the bottom of the screen disappears more often than not and when that happens I can't use my Bluetooth controls at all, which I use Spotify mostly at work and cannot stop what I am doing to close and reopen. Most of the time it freezes or won't respond! Shuffle isn't shuffle anymore it plays the same few songs instead of the whole playlist. A lot of times in the same order.",NEGATIVE
Spotify really gives me the groove while doing my tasks.,POSITIVE
I will only give 2 star because its good app in first but until the one new update its not good i can't choose what i want to listen and i can't skip it! It makes me lose my patience that's why uninstall it,NEGATIVE
Getting so sick and tired of this auto play feature whenever I connect my earphones. I've gone through the settings and there is no option currently to switch this awful feature off. Please fix this.,NEGATIVE
"Can someone on Spotify's end fix this I can't play my playlist or any podcasts that I want to listen to every time I tried to play a songs it automatically crashes, will edit my rating once this is fixed. Thank you",NEGATIVE
Nice music I love FNF and you have it thank you so much,POSITIVE
It's very good when you buy the premium but with out it it's harder to navigate and play songs.,NEGATIVE
So I'm getting mad because every time I look up a song I WANT TO HEAR a different SONG PLAYS IDK HOW TO TAKE IT OFF BUT PLEASE TAKE IT OFF OR I'M DELETEING THE APP JK but fr please look into it.,NEGATIVE
MY APP IS NOT WORKING!!!!!! Fix ur app Spotify!!!!,NEGATIVE
"I enjoyed the premium but suddenly my payment stopped working. I tried updating payment but it didn't work. I had to go to free version(which I hate) ended up having to uninstall. Please fix the payment issue, I really want my premium back.",NEGATIVE
"Hi SPOTIFY AB, This app is outstanding and remarkable. The audio quality is very nice. But the problem is, in many songs the lyrics are wrong. It's very uncomfortable. I hope it would be good if you say how to change the lyrics in songs. Thank you",NEGATIVE
"I am a new user and am enjoying Spotify. One improvement would be a sleep timer. I love to go to sleep at night and have the music turn off. It would be nice to have an alarm, as well.",NEGATIVE
I have been downloading stuff for offline play but I have no idea what it is. Please include a way for users to see what is being downloaded in the app.,NEGATIVE
App is good but a lot of ads after some time,NEGATIVE
too many ads now,NEGATIVE
It's getting worst with every update. I have been using Spotify since real long but now with every update the quality and ui is degrading. It makes no sense to put all these weekly/monthly updates. It's buggy and crashes all the time. So disappointed. New Spotify relies more more on the internet. So what's the point of getting smooth offline premium features.,NEGATIVE
"Love the App. Offline setting must be on homepage and downloaded music be easier organized, all in an effort to be able to play your music when offline!",NEGATIVE
"I miss old Spotify, were u can listen to your song first, before you put it on your playlist, I don't like the update â˜¹ï¸",NEGATIVE
App has become slower. Doesn't load. Can't search for songs.,NEGATIVE
Just now down loaded it. Haven't had a chance to use it,NEGATIVE
It doesn't work properly this is only watse of time,NEGATIVE
Offlate its not upto the mark! Pls fix the issue! It's not working properly. Even after deleting and reinstalling.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is Absolutely amazing, I just wish it didn't cost so much.",POSITIVE
Very baf habit of continuous advertisements hate it ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©,NEGATIVE
"The app is good but I just can't stand why the albums covers have such a bad quality, even the canvas, it looks like in the ugliest resolution posible",NEGATIVE
Exceptional app apart from the fact that they charge you for listening to music but I guess thats their only form of making money,NEGATIVE
I give 3 star because of i logout my account at night and in morning i try to login but i can't because of i forget my password and reason behind i forget my password because I'm using since very long time then i go with mail that also not happening sometimes too many attempts sometimes network is not working I Have Premium also even then this happening what can i do now please resolve this problem ASAP,NEGATIVE
I gave 2 stars on this app because on the update that it makes me harder to listen music everytime i search and play my fav. Song another song will play i hope that the shuffle thing will be fix its really hard to listen music.,NEGATIVE
I had Pandora since 2013 maybe before then I can't remember. When I found out about Spotify around 2017 I have never used anything else for a music app. I think ima stick with this for a long time unless something better comes out,NEGATIVE
Worst app EVER to listen to music i can even play my music it keeps changing it to random things i hate this app pls fix this,NEGATIVE
GOD THIS APP IS SO ANNOYING !! THE ADS ARE SO ANNOYING AND I ONLY GET FIVE SKIPS??? SPOTIFY SUCKS I DONT WANT YOUR STUPID PREMIUM BULL.,NEGATIVE
Not working properly,NEGATIVE
"Tunes, podcasts, concerts, no commercials, just great music great app thanks ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
Best music app by far especially with premium,POSITIVE
Lots of great content to keep you busy.,POSITIVE
Love it. I can find whatever I want 99% of the time,POSITIVE
The app doesn't even start after this annoying update,NEGATIVE
"Amazing app....but still far from perfect. Many songs in regional languages are not available, improvement is needed in that regard.",NEGATIVE
Very very good and ni ads this is best app,POSITIVE
Why same liked songs list getting downloaded everyday? Otherwise it can't be played offline. Then what is the use of paying money every month? It should be downloaded only one time. Please improve it,NEGATIVE
"To the team of spotify, this is to inform you that I dont have any active subscription and i haven't paid one(not even the tried the trial) but I'm not getting any advertisements in the middle of playlists like the premium users... please check what it is! Thank you!",NEGATIVE
"I get Best music ever, on this app",POSITIVE
doesn't play the song I want to play. Random songs.,NEGATIVE
"Since the new update, I can't actually see what song is playing in my notifications widget. I actually have to go into the app to skip or do anything. Swiping down on notifications doesn't show that Spotify is actually active",NEGATIVE
Love this app! But it keeps on shutting down everytime I start playing music. Is it only me? Or anybody else experiencing the same?,NEGATIVE
"Only one subscription available from install, why can't we register a family plan from the start. Why does your company need to keep credit card info? Cant you run the subscription service through Google play like other competitors? You make it more difficult than it needs to be...",NEGATIVE
"Used to like this aap. But now i don't like this aap as i am unable to listen to my favorite songs, it is added to a playlist and is not playing solo , also when i tried to return to song in shuffle list it was not working.",NEGATIVE
Every day Spotify and I find more and more music,POSITIVE
"Really good app, sometimes freezes and you have to close it but that doesn't bother me too much. Would be nice if it didn't do that tho",NEGATIVE
"Too many advertisement,horrible, exploit customers and repeatedly crashing app that's why deleted this n now app is crashing every time I start it",NEGATIVE
I thought this was the best app possible...but it has given me headache now...every two three days it ll stop working altogether! I need to clear cache thn may be clear storage or may be needs to be updated ðŸ˜žoverallso unreliable....because these issues crop of all of sudden and when not expected,NEGATIVE
My experience is very good because this is the only app I used at home during work . Hearing podcasts and songs are cool ðŸ˜ŽðŸ†’,POSITIVE
Too many ads. Otherwise it's a good app,POSITIVE
This app was fine until the past few days. The app doesn't open I can't search songs.,NEGATIVE
"For some reason, I just keep getting spammed about allowing blue tooth connection, there's not even a no option, it's either yes or later. No matter how many tines I press yes, I'll still get this annoying pop up. Secondly, turning on offline mode makes playlists take forever to show up, like it's still seeking a connection and will sometimes not even play songs even though these are downloaded on my phone. Pop ups that force my interaction are toxic and this needs be to removed.",NEGATIVE
Way too many ads like i will be listening to my songs and 5 ads come on like I'm fine listening to 1 or 2 ads but anything more I get mad cuz of that but everything else is great.,POSITIVE
"I like Spotify and all but I kinda wish they added back the feature to preview songs before adding them to playlist? It made making playlist easier for me, ecpecially song I forget what certain songs sound like.",NEGATIVE
this is best app for listening song.,POSITIVE
"I don't have any complaints over the app but, I've got a suggestion if you can consider. I was just thinking, if there would be an option to mute all notifications that could disturb the song. Like a slider near shuffle or repeat option so that the user can listen songs without disturbances. But keeping in mind the importance of the notifications in one's life, this option could be turned off manually or automatically when someone clears the RAM or closes the app.",NEGATIVE
Not able to preview songs in the add songs to playlist menus like I used to be able to.,NEGATIVE
Old previous/pause/next song design was good. Now they have shifted play button ot the bottom.,NEGATIVE
Please fix the UI. Everyone I know has the bottom title/pause bar disappear regularly.,NEGATIVE
"Sir, my Spotify is not working my internet is good but he says you are offline I try every thighs but still it is not working ðŸ™ please solve us problem",NEGATIVE
I don't like not being able to skip tracks well anytime I want,NEGATIVE
This application is add is not good add 3 song playing but tumi add is coming Songs is amazing,POSITIVE
"Very disappointed with this app. Idk why it's logging me out again and again. Also everytime I open it, it shows no internet connection even though I'm connected.",NEGATIVE
"This app is amazing. I once had premium and the service with premium was fantastic. Now I'll just need to save some money to get premium again. I love how they have the lyrics time synced with the songs. One small issue though, sometimes the lyrics are wrong or they show they show the music symbol for a solo part of a song to early or late. Other than that the app is great overall. I don't like the adds with the free service though. They're all terrible.",POSITIVE
I'm a bit frustrated with the settings. It always seems to be running unless I force close it. I don't want it to autoplay when I turn on my car and yet it still does with auto-start denied and spotify connect turned off. Plus the battery manager says that it is running for several hours after I stop playing music.,NEGATIVE
"Way too much ads. Okay I understand the benefits of buying premium but that doesn't mean I have to watch an unskippable ad after every song. Downloaded this app with excitement, no excitement left now.",NEGATIVE
Very interesting more energy and enthu...,POSITIVE
It's auto close and I don't know why,NEGATIVE
Good but so much bugs over there,NEGATIVE
Very poor optimization. I constantly have problems with this app. I have to Uninstall and reinstall this app on a near daily basis.,NEGATIVE
"NicestðŸ™‚ app I've ever used , u can edit your playlist to hear the songs you would like to listen to, but the fact that you can't skip songs more than 6 times is bad ðŸ˜ž appart from that the app is super, I hope you will update the skipping (play next) and also update the back skipping (play back) thanks",NEGATIVE
It would be better if developers optimize this app for andriod Devices as i have seen there's no problem in ui and music quality in apple devices but when comes to andriod it has laggy ui as well as not so good music quality..,NEGATIVE
"Who thought putting the pause button to the left was a good idea...if it ain't broke don't fix it, these ui designers are just looking for something to do",NEGATIVE
"They keep adding songs go my playlist if there are less than 15 songs. And I only get 6 skips an hour . The commercials are offensive to me and there is no way to block them without getting premium, YouTube at least let's you skip them if they over 15 seconds. The one plus is that I can play it with my phone closed so it doesn't drain my battery. Also it automatically shuffles your songs so you can't randomly pick one to listen to hence why you might prefer a shorter playlist.",NEGATIVE
"The app has been full of bugs the last 4months. Continuous unstable connections when reception and data is in abundance, songs freezing, playlists not loading (both downloaded and streaming). Very frustrating when paying for a premium service.",NEGATIVE
This so sux I can't even play the liked video if I click it's going to change idk it's bug but I think it's not so don't download this. This app so super ultra sux app,NEGATIVE
I really like Spotify but the only reason i gave it a 1 star is bc of all the ads i got 16 ads after i finished listening 1 song,NEGATIVE
"I have been using this app since the day it was launched in India. This app has one of the best music recommending engine in India. The best feature is playing songs remotely between devices, it is addictive. The ads drove me crazy so I have shifted to premium which has some extra features (Ads are extremely annoying after a week!!). I highly recommend using spotify.",POSITIVE
It's simply the best. I love it and enjoy my music with no stress . I sleep well and music is still playing. ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Love hate relationship. Pay for premium but won't load music without service even when downloaded...,POSITIVE
"Phenomenal! Amazing library of music, it's the only streaming platform I use now. I also love how it makes playlists for me, no more searching for song after song, just pick a list and go!",POSITIVE
I always loved listening music using Spotify. With Spotify my activities become very easy and fun.,POSITIVE
"This app was my fav ,to stream music on but latest updates n their greed is making it shittier n shittier ,u can't even skip songs at ur will now , n lot of chaos dwells in there ,u search 4 a song n get a ambivalent playlist with no song i want old spotify back ,if u keep it like this u gonna loose alot of users spotify n then u gonna lament..",NEGATIVE
I'm a premium user but the app itself fails a lot and the way buttons are suddenly changed from position on screen is a pain in the @$$ been using YouTube music and works well plus you got the videos...,NEGATIVE
"I have been using this app for my music, and I LOVE it. The only thing I would highly encourage, and recommend happening is making a way for the premium version to be able to make payments possible to happen through Google Play balance. I'm not sure if I'm the only one that feels this way, but it'd be a lot safer instead of having to use a debit/credit card or even using a PayPal account for payment. I hope consideration, and making this happen will be granted too one day. Thank you.",NEGATIVE
"This app is crashing on my new Android phone. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still the same issues.",NEGATIVE
I don't like This app Because ads are coming,NEGATIVE
"The app has been crashing a lot lately, idk but pls fix it",NEGATIVE
Been a subscriber for years. Don't ever plan on leaving. Team Spotify!!!!?,NEGATIVE
Best music app ever everything thing is perfect about this,POSITIVE
This app I good but if I want to play my favorite song Spotify will play random song I hate it,NEGATIVE
Exceptional App with 1 missing feature.. you can't search songs within your Playlist which makes it hard to find your favorite songs without going through them all. Please fix this,NEGATIVE
It crashes when I play the song I don't think I'll download it again good bye,NEGATIVE
"I used to love this app so much. But these updates have killed this app. No more song previews, only 5 or 6 songs play, it's awful. How will I know if I'll like a song now!? Plus, you can't just choose a song and listen to it NOOO you have to put on a whole playlist to listen to it. Plus, the ads were tolerable but there's more than ever now. In addition, you have limited skips. On the computer you can listen to any song on repeat with unlimited skips. I think you guys are getting too greedy.",NEGATIVE
Good music and easy too use,POSITIVE
"Premium user here, used to love Spotify but now thinking about cancelling and just using a different service. App has been broken for a while now, keep having to force close it. Music will randomly stop for a couple seconds and start again without any reason. It often won't display what is actually playing but will be stuck on what I listened to the last time I used the app, then I have to force close and open up again.",NEGATIVE
Everytime I play a music. I get kicked out. Fix it?,NEGATIVE
Spotify is the boom!!!! Love this app,POSITIVE
It was working good but for 2 or 3 days it shows me 'No Internet connection'.,NEGATIVE
how come I cant play my playlist songs im only able to play samples of my songs on my playlist. what is up with that my playlist has 100 songs and thats my life so please fix that issue. idk what to do im crying rn plssss.,NEGATIVE
"pretty fantastic, just wish they'd make song radios based off the cadence of the song it's radioing rather than what other people that also like it also listen to D:",NEGATIVE
"Okay ,u have a service but the Arabic song isn't in order like if I search for (atr el haya) another song will go on,if u update that version it will have 5 stars",NEGATIVE
"Love the car feature, integrates well. Fast forward is a plus too",POSITIVE
This app comes in handy when Pandora isn't working I love using Spotify when I'm in a mood and need to drift into my own world I'm the type that always listens to music so I use this app 70% of the time,POSITIVE
Music streaming randomly locks up. Switching to different device stops playback. Sharing feature doesn't work consistently.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify has been the way I listen to music for 6 years. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality but due to recent connectivity issue's between my phone and desktop I'm not giving it 5 stars, I use my phone as a remote for spotify on a daily basis and it needs to be fixed.",NEGATIVE
"I can't listen to music! Every time i hit play, it is force closing the app!!!! Im using vivo android phone",NEGATIVE
Fix the SD card issue!,NEGATIVE
Love Spotify ben using it for years I've had premium on and off when I can afford it and I love it with her without premium sometimes I just get tired of the same songs on my YouTube playlist and always go back to using Spotify,NEGATIVE
"I'm tired that my account always seems to have problems, first with the payment and now with the lyrics option, and on top of that, the covers in songs looks like only pixels, what's going on?",NEGATIVE
My Spotify is not working from 3 days,NEGATIVE
My Playlist are gone. I click on one song and another one plays,NEGATIVE
"Why do you keep on logging me out? All my downloaded playlist is gone! Everytime there is a new update, I get logged out!!",NEGATIVE
I wish you could still make collaborative playlist and not have to invite people to collaborate. Before you could just make the playlist collaborative but now it's gone ðŸ˜•,NEGATIVE
Enjoy the ability to make any playlist I like,POSITIVE
Very easy to use and navigate. ðŸ‘ðŸŽµðŸ˜,POSITIVE
"Terrible to listen to use for listening to music if you don't have premium. I just use it for podcasts. But there are so many glitches that the team refuses to fix, despite the amount of people having these issues, with no fix available. If you want people to pay, then at least provide a good experience.",NEGATIVE
It's actually new to me and i can't stop being engrossed . Absolutely Spot on,POSITIVE
"Why do you keep on adding songs to my Playlist! I made a Playlist with one song and tried to play and it kept on playing random songs. That's when I realized below that it said ""we added these songs"" even though I don't want those songs on my Playlist and it doesn't let me remove them. Stupid app. If there was a 0 star option I would choose it.",NEGATIVE
It's done me well and I just like the way it's set up.,POSITIVE
Very good and reliable. Only issue is that sometimes music will cut off but act like it keeps playing despite my headphones having no issues but this may be an issue with my phone.,POSITIVE
"would give it a 5 but recently i can't preplay small segments of songs when im in the ""add songs"" section in playlists. hope they add it back cause I'm not familiar with all the songs recommended and i want to know how they sound before adding them to my playlist :/",NEGATIVE
"One of my favorite apps. Music choices are endless, it sounds good, the ads aren't that long, etc. I would definetly recommend this app for studying, roadtrips, homework, and lots more. :)",POSITIVE
"I just pulled Spotify back up and am blown away by the amount of commercials and the poor music choices. You really have no value offer, just more commercials will push me to not use it like I stopped using the radio.",NEGATIVE
Great but sometimes my downloaded music cannot play. I hove to connect to the internet to listen sometimes,NEGATIVE
Wonderful playlist thanks,POSITIVE
"Love Spotify , wonderful app. Wouldn't trade it.â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ’¯ðŸŒ¹",POSITIVE
Easy finding tunes and love the recommendations!,POSITIVE
The best music me personally I love ASHNIKKO and she's like soooooooo pretty ðŸ˜,POSITIVE
The best music app out there!,POSITIVE
Not brilliant experience. Can stomach the adverts but get right p****d off having suggestions foisted into my playlist that I didn't ask for or want,NEGATIVE
"Love the app. I used to use Pandora and Google Podcasts, now I just use Spotify to save room on my phone.",NEGATIVE
Just good music app,POSITIVE
It's perfect you can listen to it nonstop,POSITIVE
Spotify is a staple in my life. I don't know what I would do without my music. Great app..especially the song radio feature.,POSITIVE
I think spotify just need to hire a punjabi employee to right a perfect punjabi lyrics for punjabi songs then it will be excillent as there are many listener who wants to sing a song while listening as me ðŸ˜. I just noticed that there are many wrong lyrics over there. Overall it is good app,POSITIVE
This is my everyday medicine!!!!ðŸ’œðŸ˜ I Love this app a lotttttttttt ðŸ¤§,POSITIVE
This app is amazing but there are still some songs they need to add like some Punjabi songs and also songs of some new movies,POSITIVE
"It's really good on my tablet. No issues there, everything works with no problem. HOWEVER, as soon as it comes to my phone it only let's me view 30 seconds of a song. What's up with that? This really annoys me as what if I just want music on the go? This isn't just a brand of phone issue either as this has happened on my newest phone too. Please fix this or let me know if I need premium for phone usage. thank you",NEGATIVE
Podcasts and audiobooks a welcome addition,POSITIVE
Widget isn't working with newest update,NEGATIVE
For some reason now adding song you don't have the 15 second preview anymore wich makes it hard to add songs I like since I don't know what they are unless I go to YouTube to listen to the song and I have been using Spotify for 2-3 years I think all on different devices I have loved Spotify but now I can't add much songs to my Playlist without going through a whole process to make sure I like the song,NEGATIVE

Literally trash. There's 50 features I can think of that they're missing on top of the total garbage functionality. Literally any tech person could explain in detail how ridiculously disappointing this app is. Where's all the money going they're stealing from the Artists and Podcasters? Definitely lining the pockets of the executives and not adding a basic feature like listening history. Terrible app and you should feel bad for how terrible it is.,NEGATIVE

So, if someone could help me out with that, that'd be cool.",NEGATIVE
Would give you no stars if possible. Your Wear OS app is pure garbage. After every update need to re-download all my playlists. This is unforgivable.

"Ok ,but needs to be more attractive and user friendly",NEGATIVE
"Full of ads. I think this app is for premium users only. Now a days , It show me two ads at every 2 or 3 songs , that's is so irritating . Few day ago it show me one ad at every 30 minutes but now ads frequency has been increased . ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž *****We can't delete the history",NEGATIVE

"The songs of this App, I have no opinion because it is very good! But my opinion here is in terms of advertising of the App, listening to music is less advertising, more advertising.

I would give 5 stars if you did not have to pay to download songs I think is dumb. I can download stuff for free on Amazon music but you don't have a selection so I can give one up I gusse but if you don't go offline allot then it's great but I do less than most but that's my take.,POSITIVE
Extremely glitchy and annoying for a paid service. Biggest problem is it resets to the beginning of the JRE podcast after the ads in the middle. Still very glitchy!!,NEGATIVE
This song is so nice 10/10 I love it,POSITIVE
"I'm enjoying it, this app is like a part of my life without it i cannot understand how will I even survive in this world- too dramatic wow",POSITIVE
"It keeps closing when i press play. Very disappointed. Tried everything from reinstalling to signing out, didn't help .",NEGATIVE
"Spotify is the glitchiest app on my phone - it turns itself off mid-song, and needs resetting all the time because the interface malfunctions. And I pay for it every month!",NEGATIVE
15 ADS IN A ROW!! If I have to sit through that much I should be able to listen to my playlists.,NEGATIVE
My Spotify app is closing automatically when I open and playing the song WT should I do now,NEGATIVE
Im on premium but ever since it updated I cannot access spotify on lock screen while playing. Its tedious to open my phone just to switch the song ðŸ˜© please fix it,NEGATIVE
Make it so either there is no recommend songs or make it so they won't play the songs it recommend(I forgot how to edit reviews so I deleted and remade),NEGATIVE
Spotify is an awesome music and podcast app. I have got every song that I have searched for.,POSITIVE
"Great app! But it keeps playing different songs everytime I play a specific song. Honestly, it ruined the whole experience for me. Deleting this app until they make some changes.",NEGATIVE
"App not working on Airtel fiber , have to turn on mobile data",NEGATIVE
"Music app that is easy to listen to and fun, I've been using this app for a long time and so far I haven't had any problems. Premium options are really profitable if you is a true music listener!",POSITIVE
I mean the app is not bad but the annoying thing is it keeps automaticly turning off everytime I play or open an app so yea ðŸ‘Ž,NEGATIVE
"Don't show plan expiry warning and remove all downloaded songs. I was listening my songs and I heard add and I got to know that my 1 year plan has expired, I renewed it but all downloaded song were gone. Spotify should lock these song or show option to clean. It's second time it's happening if it's happen during travelling or in journey then it's hit differently. So please make this option. Where it can keep our downloaded songs, and give us option to delete until set lock on them.Thank you.",NEGATIVE
I personally think there are so many ads and it make the listener irritative. I'm not a premium member but still....,NEGATIVE
It's a really good music app and Injoy it alot and it always has new music every week for u to listen to.,POSITIVE
"At least one bug problem, I play my liked songs but it jumped into another playlist randomly",NEGATIVE
Excessive ads Completely punishing amount of ads. 5x 30-45 second long ads for 2 songs then 3 more 30 second ads. Premium is cool and all but you shouldn't have to be forced to buy it unless you want a 3/4 ad based playlist. Never buying premium again. This ladies and gentlemen is ad blinding 101.,NEGATIVE
App getting crashing when playing a song in Vivo v20 please check the issue...,NEGATIVE
This is a really good music platform and even without premium you don't get that much ads. The music is sooo good tho â™¡â™¡â™¡,POSITIVE
I Couldn't access Spotify when I'm using mobile data. Its showing offline whenever I tried to search or play music and this is happening for a month. I thought it was my data problem but It wasn't. I'm really starting to hate this app!!!,NEGATIVE
I can't use this app and it has so many bug after updating pls fix it whenever I play song it doesn't play and it send back to homepage pls resolve this issue.,NEGATIVE
Optimum sound quality.,POSITIVE
So bugged. Been bugged since I've used it for years. Have to uninstall and reinstall at least once a week to fix certain issues,NEGATIVE
When i open the app it's automatically closing,NEGATIVE
I really love the computer version of this app but on phone or any mobile device the app is completely garbage I went to go and listen to music but first I had to listen to 2 minutes of adds just great and I cant listen to a song of my choice I search without premium this app is a complete waste of time and storage unless you want to pay for music each month,NEGATIVE
I'm so pissed that there isn't an easy way to get ahold of Spotify. So I'm just gonna leave them a bad review because I took off my payment method from last month and they still charged me this month!!! I want to dispute it ASAP!!!!,NEGATIVE
"Idk why but since past week I'm having issues with playing any song, i can't even play one random song with premium.",NEGATIVE
"2 songs at most before on average 3-5 adds in a row, than you can't pick a specific song you want to listen to, it's a random choice not what you want, the only good thing that this has between the other versions is you can have a quick listen instead of playing the whole song and making daily mix give you dumb songs",NEGATIVE
I love this damn app till the end of time.,POSITIVE
please make it available for through prepaid payment so that easier for those who don't have credit card especially student like me. over all its super good and working just fine for me.,POSITIVE
Only played rubbish suggested songs on my playlist and I don't even know what the original songs I picked were now even with the setting off! Also gave me adverts after every song! DO NOT GET!!!,NEGATIVE
"I always hook up my phone to the Xbox so I can listen through my headphones as I play but the problem is that I have it set to full volume and it's still quiet. I tried seeing if there was any settings I could use to change this but it's only on mobile, not Xbox",NEGATIVE
Giving 4 start Bcoz i didn't found all the songs which I wanted. But overall best app for songs and clearity of the songs is awesome.. Premium membership is too good.,POSITIVE
"I think overall the app is fine and I use it often. But I have a few things I would like added, such as the ability to loop on mobile and play just one song without shuffle. Thanks!",POSITIVE
It is very good as long as it is free.,POSITIVE
It's so cool because I can listen to my favorite songs and make our own Playlist,POSITIVE
"Right after the update, the pp begins to act poorly. It crashes everytime I try to play a song. Please fix this issue.",NEGATIVE
"Brilliant, easy to use and has a wide range of songs",POSITIVE
Spotify knows what you want to listen to. It just plays that. Caution: Spotify addiction may cause insomnia.,NEGATIVE
The song collection needs to be increased by love the quality,NEGATIVE
Doesn't always work through my car play system. Very frustrating. Especially noticeable in the last couple of weeks,NEGATIVE
"Ok. All i have to say. Is 7 ads. 7 ads. 7 ads, you literally gave me 7 ads",NEGATIVE
"I loved it It had best experience instead of other applications. But after latest update, When I open it it automatically closes Please fix this quickly as possible......",NEGATIVE
Great as you can select your favourite music,POSITIVE
Great music service plus not taking away sales from else where and very helpful,POSITIVE
"The new update is the worst update ever. I try making a Playlist with only a few songs and Spotify automatically adds songs to the recommendation list, I try getting rid of them but they won't stop adding. They also got rid of the repeat button for non premium users. I've been with Spotify for about 5 years and now I'm done.",NEGATIVE
Paid for premium and can't play a damn single music. Keeps on crashing after pressing the play button. What an app. Will give zero star if there was an option.,NEGATIVE
"This application USED to be good. For a while now, whenever I play podcasts on my Samsung Galaxy phone, the audio will randomly stop after a few minutes of playing. It also has weird bugs where it doesn't show ti be playing a song, but the audio is coming through. Very disappointing how this app has fallen from being benchmarking, in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Why i can't play my Spotify?? When i try to play, it will auto close.. try to log in back, still not working.. also reinstall, also not working... Can u guys fix the problem... ðŸ¥º",NEGATIVE
When I try to play a song it automatically closes..what the hell is wrong with this app..uninstall and still the sameðŸ¤¦,NEGATIVE
I can listen to my song with out and problems love this app,POSITIVE
FIX THE SHUFFLE also pretty good there a bit to many ads though. E,POSITIVE
Very easy to use good quality music,POSITIVE
Awesome Sauce!!! Highly recommend!!! No Commercials!!!!,POSITIVE
"Overall, this app has been wonderful except since the latest download. I can no longer play song samples to see if it's a song I recognize. Very poor decision to take away this feature.",NEGATIVE
Its good until it stops giving you the 30 minutes ad free,POSITIVE
"It's a good app, but all the sudden when I'm listening to podcasts here lately, it's been jumping to the next episode on its own, and I'm having to go back to the previous episode and find my place. It's getting old because it just does it randomly.",NEGATIVE
Great until you can't go two songs without five ads.,POSITIVE
Able to get into other apps whilst listening to musicðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Not working...before 2 days stop working and not sign up,NEGATIVE
After last update the app is crashing if i press play button and i saw many people facing same issue and they posted in Spotify community and it works fine when I install previous versions .,POSITIVE
"It was crashing when I want to play a song in the Spotify App. I didn't face any issues , but from two days I facing this issue please fix it. Almost I am using it from two years. Please fix it",NEGATIVE
I give one star only because mugamoodi movie songs and dheena movie songs are not added.,NEGATIVE
Spotify was okay a month ago but the recent update just sucks. It'll just randomly stop in the middle of a song and i have to go back to play it again. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!!!,NEGATIVE
"App is crashing a lot , unable to use it.",NEGATIVE
It's an amazing experience I am used so many apps but this one is just super,POSITIVE
little bugs like sometimes song doesn't get played and get stopped after 9 sec of playing.,NEGATIVE
"I liked the app a lot and use it for over two years now. But since the update it isn't fun to use at all anymore. Music stops as if I don't have connection, after a restart it is OK for a moment. Player doesn't open as usual, no way to pause, skip or to set up up the sleep timer. Sometimes it works after restarting, but now it doesn't work at all. I'm gonna cancel my subscription till this problem is solved.",NEGATIVE
"The app is amazing, except for one thing. When I make a Playlist, it adds random songs to it. There's no setting to turn this off either. If I want a Playlist containing songs I like, I don't want random songs I may find inappropriate added to the Playlist. Don't tell me to get premium either, it's absurd to force extra content onto someone. Premium should be to add content, not removing forced content. Other than that, I guess it's ok...",POSITIVE
Really nice music through this App.,POSITIVE
Would be 5 stars but Spotify keeps adding annoying songs to my playlist I dont like and wont let me remove them.,NEGATIVE
Used to be a 5 star review but no 2 star.. I bought premium because I was leaving for the summer and now offline music DOESNT WORK.. fix this please,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is an excellent app, but payment is difficult in my region ðŸ¥º. A lot of us in Nigeria can't pay for subscription because it doesn't accept our cards. Helppppp! I'm gonna cry if I lose my music.",NEGATIVE
Nice and easy to use.,POSITIVE
"Great up until a few weeks ago, everything pauses randomly.",NEGATIVE
It's good although the ads are sometimes annoying but overall it's a good experience,POSITIVE
"Ridiculous! I am logging in with an old account of mine but after logging in, only Spotify logo coming on screen instead of my account... Please help me out with a solution,how to fix this glitch or bug?",NEGATIVE

Why is it soo hard to log in?,NEGATIVE
"Idk why but whenever i play something the app just crashes. I've tried restarting my phone, even uninstalling and reinstalling the app nothing seems to work",NEGATIVE
The app is not working on mobile data. Even though the connection is very good. Please help. Thankyou.,NEGATIVE
My spotify app is always crashing. I can't play even a single song. Someone please look into this.,NEGATIVE
Great music where and when I want it !!!,POSITIVE
I've been so much inspired in the next few months I have been listening to the Spotify. Thanks,POSITIVE
Love the way you can add different playlists. definitely a good music app.,POSITIVE
Amazing experience. All tyoes of songs available. Love it...,POSITIVE
Tbh I want to give 5 for experience but as for the play list discover weekly it never seems to update on time and never has songs that are based on your interests,NEGATIVE
It's good when it plays a full song with pauseing,POSITIVE
Malfunctions all the time. 1) have to force stop all the time since pause button disappears 2) sometimes just stops altogether 3) sometimes stops mid podcast and starts an entirely different one Awesome stuff. Fix it maybe?,POSITIVE
ðŸŒ¸I can listen to all the music I like with no trouble ðŸŒ¸,POSITIVE
I love it no adds and you can listen to favorite songs on different apps so very highly recommended,POSITIVE
Really a good app for listening to music,POSITIVE
"They tricked me very well, they drugged me with so much selections, then they dropped me while i wanted to listen too my choice, then a whole bunch of advertising",NEGATIVE
"Still a bit glitchy, but working much better! Great app.",POSITIVE
This app won't let me play the song that I chose. It plays random song no matter what I chose. DON'T INSTALL AND LOOK FOR OTHER MUSIC APP.,NEGATIVE
Please fix the latest update. I cannot play any song. It keeps on crashing once I click play button. Device: VIVO V21 Location: PH,NEGATIVE
Trash app all I listen whole day is just add,NEGATIVE
When I am playing a aong it always crashes.,NEGATIVE
Love the playlist that ya'll put together!,POSITIVE
Ads are definitely a little aids but it's better than everything else.,POSITIVE
"Since my phone did an update in early May (Samsung A20) Spotify won't work. I've already contacted Spotify and they claimed they'd work on it. But it's been a month, still no fixes. Cannot use the Spotify app, nothing plays, my Playlist is gone.",NEGATIVE
"Premium is great, I really recommend getting it, makes listening to your music fun and easy, never had any problems with premium either.",POSITIVE
"Holy Skynet Batman! I was listening to Spotify yesterday and turned it off after an hour or so. Then today I was listening to a rough recording I just made of a piano arrangement I'm working on, turned that off, and Spotify kicked back in right where I turned it off yesterday. The app was not even in use, it just decided to do that even though it was supposedly off. I couldn't find a way to turn it off, so I rebooted the phone and it came right back. Whose damn device is this anyway?",NEGATIVE
It's a very good app. 4 stars cause nothing is really perfect in world,POSITIVE
"Mobile version for free is pretty awful but as soon as I got a job I was able to pay for the student plan and it's great. I love the local files features, I learned to create folders so I can easily organize all my playlists and the UI is easy to understand",POSITIVE
"What happened. Use to be good now it crashes, doesn't even play whole songs and I'm a premium subscriber. Now the price has increased, will be un subscribing soon",NEGATIVE
This app was great when I first downloaded it but this new feature that came with the update just proved the negative comments right So y'all are telling me that I can't fast forward more that 6 song or something like that? And on top of that I can't even choose a specific song from an album which makes absolutely no scense,NEGATIVE
"I've been uninstall & reinstall this app for more than 10x, always auto close & back to my home screen, use the app for pc & phone, this problem only occur on my android phone, please do something otherwise i'll unsubscribe.",NEGATIVE
"So far, in 30 minutes, I have not heard a single song from MY 20 song playlist. It's all the stupid suggested songs. DO NOT GET THIS, PANDORA IS WAY BETTER",NEGATIVE
Queue doesn't work sometimes. Oftentimes the control panel doesn't show up on the notification bar. Podcasts don't update regularly. Appears to be programmed by literal infants. Why tf am I even paying 10 bucks for this unreliable buggy mess ?! Edit: New Update came out. Didn't fix a thing. Still terrible. 2nd Edit: New update. Zero fixes. It's getting ridiculous y'all...,NEGATIVE
My extensive down load list replaced my apple playlist and now I'm free from apple and ipods,NEGATIVE
"I tried to listen to anything, let alone just search in the search box, but it constantly said I had no internet connection available, even when connecting to the Wi-Fi, I even turned off mobile data to see if that helped. I couldn't even use the app.",NEGATIVE
"I'm just loving the random crashing and restarts of the app. hey, at least they finally have a sleep timer though. Update: now they moved 'recently played' off the 'home' landing page and stuck it under 'your library'. I hope the brain trust that made that move enjoyed their avacodo toast and soy latte as they pat themselves on the back for that brilliant decision. STOP FUDGING WITH UI AND STICK TO FIXING BUGS!!! Update 05June2022; Recent update has now resulted in even MORE crashes.Awesome job",POSITIVE
"When I first got Spotify it worked absolutely fine, but lately the songs that I have been playing haven't popped into my notifications, so I have to go on to the actual app to pause or skip the song, and sometimes the song randomly stops and I have to go on to the app to play the song again. Does anyone else experience this? It's been really recent for me. Edit: Now my Spotify is working completely fine, don't know what happened though.",NEGATIVE
Definitely the greatest collect of music and awesome podcasts especially Joe Rogan,POSITIVE
Scam it only works if you buy Premium. I search some songs but when I play another songs automatically play. Is this a Bug? Or is just Spotify really just Favored those who in Premiums. æ™ºæ…§,NEGATIVE
"App runs horrible on my S21 Ultra. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. Honestly hot it because of the 9.99 for 3 months deal, but I don't think I'll be using after this. Constantly passes my podcasts for no reason, so I have to keep going back into the app to resume. I'm a truck driver so this is very annoying, seeing that this is one of my only sources of entertainment for most of the day.",NEGATIVE
"Spotify was the best thing that happen to life. Work and studying are so much easier with spotify, and I have music for every mood Im in, even if Im not awake, and if I need something to fall asleep too, I only hape to press one button.",NEGATIVE
Amazing quality and choice off artists ðŸŽ¨,POSITIVE
I wish the phone app wasn't increase its storage space by itself. I'm not doing anything but app incrase its storage space up to 12 GB.,NEGATIVE
This music is super awesome..,POSITIVE
Literally none of my songs in my playlist are playing its only random songs that I didn't ask to hear i don't wanna hear it just let me listen to what's in my playlist.,NEGATIVE
Recently tried logging back into my account on my phone but was unable to. They would not send me an email or instructions on how to reset my password. There are also way to many adds. The app plays multiple adds in a row and rarely ever gives you an option to get 30 minutes of add-free music. Went ahead and deleted the app and got Pandora.,NEGATIVE
Excellent app. I've never had a single problem with it. I love having millions of songs available at any time. Couldn't live without music and by extension this app. Premium subscriber for the last 4 years and no reason to ever change that thus far.,NEGATIVE
Spotify is good but I only rated four stars because first of all you can only listen to it on one device at a time if you try and open it on more than one device the first device just stops playing. Second of all it glitches a lot if you try and skip a song sometimes it'll go to the previous song and then skip to the one that you wanted to go to and then go back to the first one then go to the one that you wanted to go to and then stay there. But other than that it's really good.,POSITIVE
Love this app. Love my music!,POSITIVE
Keeps crashing on Android before it worked normallly,NEGATIVE
Awesome app for music,POSITIVE
high quality music and a user friendly interface,POSITIVE
Love listening to spotify and podcasts,POSITIVE
I love Spotify but I don't like that after a time limit you have shuffle and I don't like that and I do not want to buy premium.,NEGATIVE
It's really dumb how I can't cancel my premium on the app and the fact that they don't have a call center for help is a big downside since I can't contact them personally to cancel a subscription to an account I can no longer access,NEGATIVE
"I love Spotify ,,,it's my favourite app of all time ðŸ‘",POSITIVE
"i find it stupid that im using spotify premium, yet i have to be connected to the internet in order TO PLAY my DOWNLOADED playlist. it should've been played since the essence of having spotify on premium is to listen to music wherever u are even in the most deserted land. this is just plain disappointment",NEGATIVE
Great sound and the way a person can build a playlist fantastic!!Superb!!,POSITIVE
I love this Spotify I can listen to all my favorite music all day ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Phenomenal but app keeps crashing since last update,NEGATIVE
"Waaaaay to many advertisements now, time for youtube! Used to be a great app, however the amount of adds is waaaaay to much.",POSITIVE
constantly freezes up,NEGATIVE
you cant go some where and listen to music without internet.,NEGATIVE
"skips, always. 4 or 5 commercials between tracks. difficult to play albums or sole artists.",NEGATIVE
Amazing free songs,POSITIVE
"Spotify is neither good or bad, it has a bunch of ads, but many and when I say many I mean heck ton of music from all kinds of creators, recommend.",POSITIVE
I've enjoyed ad-free music for a couple of years now. Haven't had any issues technically or otherwise.,POSITIVE
Fun.lots of entertainment.I just find the app to be great,POSITIVE
Good morning When I first got hooked up with Spotify love it to be truthful about it l just got to have it all day and GOD knows l need it..l listen to the new young Christian gospel song amen.good stuff..,POSITIVE
Edit: Doesn't play the song I've been linked to. What's the point of my friends sharing songs if I literally cannot listen to them? old: I got it so I could listen to songs my friend sends me. Five ads played and I gave up on waiting for them to be over and just searched the song on YouTube instead.,NEGATIVE
"Always add tunes I don't like!!! I'd rather use my data on stuff I like, not wasting it on deleting s... .on the verge of uninstalling the app!! I don't have broadband etc so really annoys meðŸ¤¬",POSITIVE
"I hate that it shuffles your music when you SEARCH for a specific song, the playlists that you make? Sure. But if I wanna listen to deviltown, can't I just listen to it? Instead of having to waste my skips on not being able to hear it.",NEGATIVE
The service is great! Just a suggestion about the shuffle of the songs many of them just repeats frequently without playing all the songs in playlist.. the algorithm may need some updates to identify songs already played. Thx.,NEGATIVE
Love the parcast podcasts!!,POSITIVE
"I love the playlist it creates for friends to share music, but it's very very buggy. It was adding random audio book chapters that neither of us had EVER listened to, nor had in our library. I genuinely thought someone had hacked my account and added random things! The offline mode just doesn't work. I have to turn my data on whenever I open the app until I get a podcast/downloaded music playing, then I can turn it off. Now I'm unable to search for anything online or offline ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
Best music streaming,POSITIVE
"Excellent app, I've never not be unable to find a song or Album.",POSITIVE
Non stop adds.ITS STUPID,NEGATIVE
I would like to thank the team who launch spotify !* Like so so much good app to enjoy the music and podcastes are so amazing!!!!! i love it so much After geting the premium package from spotify i enjoy it more bcoz there is no intruption of ads and it allow to download the music and enjoy it while you are offline thats a good feature and yaa thats it :),POSITIVE
"Great app, absolutely love it...But needs to be advert free- and not a person in the world should need to pay to get rid of adverts.",NEGATIVE
Gets one star because I can't find a way to play playlists in order. Shuffle should not be the default and finding a way to play in order should not be so difficult.,NEGATIVE
It's an amazing app for music lovers like me. ads became less than before UI is also good but music recommendation is not satisfying. That's why I rated only 4 star.,NEGATIVE
I love spotify. But sometimes it doesmt show the play bar at the bottom of the screen or notification in my notification center which makes it super annoying to find out whats playing. I also cant pause or skip while that is happening. Ive talked to other people about it and the same thing happens to them.,NEGATIVE
"Well I've got 2 things to complain about. 1. There used to be this thing where you srarch up a song and you can listen to a fraction of it, now it's gone. If you wanna make sure its the song u want, or to just browse new songs, u have to play them individually, which makes it very uncomfortable. 2. There's no option to stop the app from playing SUGGESTED songs after it plays some of the playlist's. It's frustrating, becouse most of the suggested songs aren't my type at all.",NEGATIVE
Fantastic music app,POSITIVE
Stop putting random music thats not in my playlist even if my playlist is way over 15 music you keep putting random music that i don't like so really bad app pls fix it,NEGATIVE
"There are too many ads , which is really very disturbing!!!!",NEGATIVE
Music pauses randomly and I have Uninstalled and installed it 3 times. Paying for premium and still have these issues is unacceptable. Please fix asap! Thank you,NEGATIVE
I'm not able to play any song..app is crashing whenever I click on play,NEGATIVE
"Ive been a premium subscriber for the last 5 years, but I'm so fed up with the latest update, that I'm going to look for another music app instead. The shuffle feature can't be turned off and is so annoying when trying to play my albums. Then for some reason it's just added tracks into my albums, that I don't like and I can't remove them, so doubly annoying. I can't preview tracks, before downloading, so no idea if they are the ones I'm looking for or not? So many problems now ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE
Not sure if its just my phone but the app keeps randomly crashing and stopping songs every few minutes :(,NEGATIVE
Ahhhh this app randomly crashes and then it will not be useful to play any type of songs ...........it's very irritating,NEGATIVE
"Senior First timer! I can't afford premium rate...so I need to be more patient with the adds. I'm still learning how to use it and it's good , that in a way I can listen my favorite music and artists .It would be nice to include special rates to seniors ðŸ™‚. Thanks and Blessings ! Be Safe! Be nice!â¤ Granny ðŸ‘µ 67",POSITIVE
Group sessions sometimes don't work.,NEGATIVE
I love Spotify and have been using it for a few years now but there have been a few times when I'll go into the app and it'll say no internet connection so then I'll uninstall and reinstall it but now it's doing that to me and it's not even letting me reinstall the app.,NEGATIVE
Sometimes the 30m of ad free music dosent work and i get an ad right after it but other than that its ok,POSITIVE
It's not working properly it gets close and didn't work properly ads are too many,NEGATIVE
"Latest update and my ""now playing"" is missing and I am unable to skip songs or see what is playing.",NEGATIVE
"Used to have no problem playing any songs, but suddenly the app crashes everytime I started to click the play button! I have to restart my phone every once in a while due to this issue. Please fix it!",NEGATIVE
The mostly lovely music app i have ever seen. My weekly mixtapes always drive me crazy. Am in love ðŸ’•,POSITIVE
great app! The automix needs to be more creative in mixing the tracks though. its sounds bland for now but that will change in the near future. Maybe the next Spotify automix upgrade will be able to transition from track to track in ways that are imaginative and edgy! Like an artificial DJ. Can't wait!,NEGATIVE
"Absolutely love, this app. Listen to music not been on the app. Some Audio books and podcasts. Things for children and animals too",POSITIVE
Crashing after new update.. can't play songs (premium account) Android version 12 :( Waste money:(,NEGATIVE
"After I read other ppl review, I also encounter the same issue.. I can't open in my phone, clear cache, uninstall n reinstall, off n turn on, log in n log out.. all the possible steps to recover back the Spotify.. but it still fail to play the song after 2 seconds I play the song..",NEGATIVE
"This app worked fine for about a month, then after the update it stopped showing me my playlists so i can play a specific song, i reached out to the service email and havent gotten a word back yet. This money hungry company doesnt care about its consumers and breaks every five seconds. Until they reach out to me and fix the issue my rating will remain and i will no longer use this app.",NEGATIVE
Great Expeirience; I can also Appreciate the 30 minutes Free Listening after an AD it makes me want to at least check out the ad..Great Experience,POSITIVE
"Lovely gospel music,sound quality is amazing",POSITIVE
Can u put something where we can choose what we want to listen to instead of going through a play list,NEGATIVE
This is my go to when I'm looking to find new music similar to artists I â¤ï¸,POSITIVE
Best app for listening music,POSITIVE
Premium option is the best. Especially if you're like me from the older generation.,POSITIVE
"Why can't I get only liked songs from an artist anymore? It just plays any songs from the artist, even if I have put some in my liked songs. I used to be able to choose to listen only to the liked songs from an artist.... That's really not good. I don't know if it's a glitch....?",NEGATIVE
I love the way it shows the lyrics,POSITIVE
"This app is crashing on my IQOO Z5 Device after 4 -5 days of installation , please do something !",NEGATIVE
Music is always on in our house. Great variety.,POSITIVE
So far I love Spotify. Had great results so far.,POSITIVE
Great to find almost any artist but what I really like is the recommendations that Spotify makes. Much of my new favorite artists were recommended so good job!,POSITIVE
After this new update..when i trying to play songs itz app stopd wrking.,NEGATIVE
how can you not give the most legit music streaming app 5 stars?,NEGATIVE
Last 2 updates faulty. App can't play and keeps crashing.,NEGATIVE
It has become the most useless. No song has been playing for some days,NEGATIVE
I just buy premium and after that my Spotify cannot be use...I have try delete and download it back for 5 times and it still didn't work,NEGATIVE
It's Spotify. I have had a Premium account for forever. Great way to listen to music to decide whether to invest in a cd or lp or concert ticket. Updated score as popup ads are back.,NEGATIVE
"Its great but the only issue i have is you dont have the sleep timer option for ""end of queue""",NEGATIVE
My app is getting close every time I try to play any song plz fix it,NEGATIVE
"Not the worst but quite bad, sometimes one wants to only listen to the things they like, yet sometimes the app will ""recommend"" and will force you to listen to said ""recommendations"" and if you skip them, then it takes up the already limited skips one already have, so that is quite annoying, and also, whenever there is an ad, they will multiply by three so instead of one I have to listen to three ads before going back to my music. So yeah not the worst thing in the world but quite bad",NEGATIVE
Excelent selection and quality sound,POSITIVE
Every time I turn on on Spotify it keeps playing and won't turn off. I went into settings and it still won't stop,POSITIVE
Since music selection has little range ittle do,NEGATIVE
It's one of the best music apps,POSITIVE
PLS HELP ME ITS SO CONFUSING I CANT FIND ANYTHING AND WONT LET ME LISTEN TO THE PLAYLISTS I MADE!!!!,POSITIVE
Shuffle sucks. Everything else good,NEGATIVE
It's so good for listening musics and podcasts,POSITIVE
Melodious collection of song of different genres.,POSITIVE
No other streaming platform can compare love Spotify,POSITIVE
Unable to login. Stuck in an endless loop between emails and app. Uninstalled.,NEGATIVE
"I've been a premium user for years and I've been mostly happy with the app. I love the customized ""Made For You"" playlists and Wrapped at the end of the year. It is a great app for music discovery. I only wish they paid artists more.",POSITIVE
NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS SPOTIFY APP JUST I LIKE SONGS,POSITIVE
I would've given 5 stars. But recently SPOTIFY STARTED TO STOPPED WORKING IN EVERY 1 DAYS.. OLA CHECK IT. IT'S SO DISAPPOINTING. I CAN'T LISTEN TO SONGS.,NEGATIVE
"Spotify is a great service,but the app gets buggy sometimes. Managing podcasts can be a chore also, but overall it's pretty good.",POSITIVE
First time user. Enjoy the variety of music choices!,POSITIVE
"I love the freedom Spotify gives you, I wish there were more price grades for music, as I don't listen to that much - if I was buying CDs it would cost me less than Â£10/month. I would also like to see more older and alternative music & sound tracks on here. I absolutely love that I can listen to ad free podcasts. I would mind the ads slightly less on the music if they were taking us towards a sustainable future and away from mindless consumerism and shallow values.",POSITIVE
I used to love this app but 3 ads every 2 songs is ridiculous,NEGATIVE
Amazing. background mode possible unlike tubing.,POSITIVE
Love Spotify. Never let's me down!,POSITIVE
"Since the last update I can no longer connect Spotify to my Google home system. I've tried reboots, relinking, and reinstalling everything. Other music platforms work just fine, but not Spotify.",NEGATIVE
"having a lot of trouble with the app right now. the playlists don't play correctly, when i tap on a song it just simply plays a 5-10 secod clip out of it. when i finally managed to play one of the songs i couldn't do anything with it rather than turn it off, i can't skip to another song, i can't play it back. idk what's happening but it'll stay on 2 stars until you fix it. edit: oh, i guess it's how free version works! good job guys, you've lost all your potential! terrible app, uninstalled.",NEGATIVE
I just want to choose a song :( but I can't because of the bad shuffle. Can you turn off the shuffle mode because I don't want to buy premium. I don't have money! :( ðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
"Love Spotify but since the last update am unable to view the song playing or pause, due to the mini controller now not visible the only way to stop the song in to force close the app. Please sort this as I really enjoy the App",NEGATIVE
"Why do you keep adding random song to people's playlist??? We only want to hear songs we like, Not what you add randomly!",NEGATIVE
I love this app the only problem with it is just when I have my own Playlist going it will turn on another song which isn't in it. Ads last a minute or two but they don't hurt at all. I would absolutely advise downloading this app for music and podcasts.,POSITIVE
I love this app no ads. But the other app had thousands of ads I'm glad I switched.â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE
Nice app for music lover.,POSITIVE
Best music player ever in Android play store.. This is very smooth in handing and not issues..highly satisfied with Spotify... I will rate 100 out of 100ðŸ˜ðŸ˜â¤â¤ Very happy with this music ðŸŽ¶app. Thanks Spotify.,POSITIVE

Easy to use. Great selection of music. Reasonably priced.,POSITIVE
My app has started crashing all of a sudden. Everytime I click on a song. There is a lot of space and RAM on my phone so I know that's not causing the crash. SPOTIFY KINDLY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.,NEGATIVE
"Ads are killing it , literally after every song comes 2 ads",NEGATIVE
Spotify is great for finding music related to searched artist and saved music.,POSITIVE
"Get in the mood you want when you want, everytime, at 0 cost! LOVE IT...!!!",POSITIVE
"shuffle keeps playing the same couple of songs ive already listened to like 30 times..and the album cover is everything..it needs to be bigger. there is so much space to do it too, thats all im asking for, bigger album covers",NEGATIVE
My complaint to this app is this app became soo buggy i click on a song then the app outomaticaly shutdown you should fix this,NEGATIVE
I love this app but it's getting ridiculous. 1. I CAN'T PLAY A SPECIFIC SONG WITHOUT PAYING!! 2. Because of no. 1 in a Playlist I can't select to start at a specific song and you only get about 3-6 skips. PLEASE FIX THATðŸ˜­,NEGATIVE
"Best app ever! Though it has some glitches, but I am very satisfied!! I can listen to all types of songs and I totally love the smart recommendation system! I would prefer this over any other app!",POSITIVE
"Been using for 6 years+, never fails to disappoint me.",POSITIVE
"Good , very good , i am happy listening Spotify thank guys for all of this is my favorite",POSITIVE
"Would've given 5 stars because I've been enjoying and using it for years now. But there are things that I didn't like, like I exit the app and I stop listening, then if I go back to the app after minutes or hours. I can't seem continue what I have been listening. I have to click my playlist again just to make the music work. I don't know what to do with this kind of thing.",NEGATIVE
Good app has a good sound quality but the only problem that I have with the app that I think u should fix is that it selects the music for u I think the user should have the option of which song they want,NEGATIVE
Why application is crashing always,NEGATIVE
I like the app keeps me going to YouTube all the time!,POSITIVE
I still Love it. Especially now that they have lyrics added on.,POSITIVE
This is a best app for music playing and the ðŸŽ¶ a song,POSITIVE

"Ads, ads and more ads. Play a 2 songs get 3 ads. No better than YouTube.",NEGATIVE
It's a good application and it's clear to listen to music,POSITIVE
What I despise about this godforsaken app is that it AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT WARNING put my music i was listening to on EVERY tv of the house. I also had to take 2 HOURS to fix one of the tv's that stopped working due to the sudden cause of it happening. Im editing this review a few mintues later to add 2 things 1 YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO A DIFFERENT SONG TO STOP THE SONG THAT WAS PLAYING (atleast i didnt know how to stop the song) and you can just use youtube and or another device to listen to music,NEGATIVE
"Great selection of artists and songs, don't exactly know where the shuffle play went though ðŸ¤”.",NEGATIVE
Needs to stop blocking my fav songs so often,NEGATIVE
"Still somehow getting worse songs just stop playing out of nowhere, takes 3 or 4 trys to just load up the app, once again great service awful app",NEGATIVE

App crashes when I play a song,NEGATIVE
The choices and ease of searching makes this app very user friendly. Only issue I have is when logging in from one phone to a new phone putting in your passcode doesn't seem to work and you have to deal with technical support. Other than that good job,NEGATIVE
It is not working properly in my vivo phone,NEGATIVE
"Complete song, i like rock and folk song",POSITIVE
I love spotify the only thing about it that when i search the name of a song it gives me a full playlist but without that song,NEGATIVE
No ads which is masyaya,NEGATIVE
"Thanks for providing so many ads here, I frequently come here to listen to those ads. I just love it ðŸ˜˜",POSITIVE
Something is definitely wrong with this app.. whenever I try to play a song the app closes automatically.,NEGATIVE
"I usually play the ""Daily Drive"" playlist, which contains music numbers and news plus other podcasts. I hate football and it still plays ""FC Afkicken"" podast. Why isn't there a button to dislike/block stupid podcasts like unliked sports!?",NEGATIVE

Good free music app but can be hard to use at times,NEGATIVE
"I'm not sure it's a bug but on Spotify free when i press shuffle songs in an album, Spotify turns songs from completely different artists",NEGATIVE

Updating again Even more unhappy with this app! It's been months now since it stopped working properly. It won't recognise my chromecast anymore! It can hardly connect to my car radio! Constantly closes itself even though when I WANT to exit the app it won't close in the background AT ALL unless I force stop the app. Honestly can't believe I'm paying premium for this many bugs??,NEGATIVE
